# Final Words

Looking forward to this bit.


## Some conclusions


* You generally cannot conclude all that much about population quantiries from only a small number of cases

## Words of warning

* WHen DAGS seem hairy
timing not clear
dominos worry


## General and specific knowledge

Sometimes  understanding and applying teh causal model is enoug, without need for additional qualitative data.


* We started with the story of the engineer and  the philosopher.


Do DAGs actually capture causal processes that qualitative researchers see -- qualitative researchers see that the domino 2 fell *the moment it was hit* by domino 1. How do we express this in a DAG?
