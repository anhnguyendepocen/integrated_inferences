# Final Words

The central idea of this book is that many of the claims we want to make as social scientists require causal models that have sufficient complexity to be able to account of how and under what conditions causal relations play out. 

The focus on design based inference that has grown in strength over the last decade has made it possible to dispense with such models, but the cost has been a narrowing of questions to focus on varients of the average causal effect. 

A shift in focus towards treating causal models as estimands holds out the promise of addressing a wide set of questions in an integrated way:

* **Case level questions**: did $X$ affect $Y$ in this instance?
* **Process questions**: did $X$ affect $Y$ in this instance?
* **Transportation questions**: what are the implications of the study of this treatment in this place for that treatment in that place?

In addition the models provide a clear *procedure* for drawing inferences. They clarify when different kinds of information will be informative for different estimands and they clarify what inferences you can draw. Even when quantities are not identified they can be used to assess when conclusions are consistent with the data for different priors. 

In providing a structure for these tasks we also gain insight into problems with how we were thinking of these things before...


## General lessons

Sometimes  understanding and applying teh causal model is enoug, without need for additional qualitative data.


## Worries about what you have to put in

**Well defined nodes?*"** Do DAGs actually capture causal processes that qualitative researchers see -- qualitative researchers see that the domino 2 fell *the moment it was hit* by domino 1. How do we express this in a DAG?

**Acyclic really?** THe first assumption made in the construction of causal models in this book is the underlying DAG. One can specify a DAG without making any substantive claims about function forms or patterns of confounding. Yet even the  DAG presents worries. 

**Theoretically deeper models.** 


## Limits on what you can get out

* **Complexity.** We have sought to use non-parametric models.. To maintain simplicity we have largely focused on models with binary nodes. At first blush this class of causal models appears very simple. In fact however we quickly learn that even with a small set of nodes produces a dizzying variety of causal types.   

* *Identification.* In modelling complete structures we see clearly how much easier it is to define problems than it is to solve them. Many of the quantities we care about are easily shown to not be identified by the causal models we employ. The causes of effect estimand is perhaps the most obvious of these. 

* *Limits of qualitative data under ignorable assignments.* You generally cannot conclude all that much about population quantiries from only a small number of cases when causal effects are identified.
