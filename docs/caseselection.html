<p>With a causal model in hand, together with priors over parameters, we can assess in advance what conclusions we will draw from different observations and assess what kinds of observations are most worth seeking. We draw out the implications of this idea for case selection. We then turn to the problem of choosing between going “wide” and going “deep.” We discuss the tradeoffs and communicate an intuition that clue data, even on a small number of cases, can be informative even when there is <span class="math inline">\(X, Y\)</span> data on a very large number of cases, but only if it provides information that cannot be gathered from <span class="math inline">\(X,Y\)</span> data, such as selection into treatment. Simulations suggest that going deep is especially valuable for observational research, situations with homogeneous treatment effects, and, of course, when clues have strong probative value.</p>
</div>
<p>A critical decision for scholars employing mixed methods is to determine when and where to look deep and when to look wide. We address this question if two steps, first addressing the problem of case selection and second the question of qualitative/quantitative mixing.</p>
<div id="case-selection-strategies" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">14.1</span> Case selection strategies</h2>
<p>A host of different strategies have been proposed for selecting cases for in-depth study based on the observed values of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> data. Perhaps the most common strategy is to select cases in which <span class="math inline">\(X=1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y=1\)</span> and look to see whether in fact <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> caused <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> in the case in question (using some more or less formal strategy for inferring causality from within-case evidence). But many other strategies have been proposed, including strategies to select cases “on the regression line” or, for some purposes, cases “off the regression line” (e.g., <span class="citation">Lieberman (<a href="#ref-Lieberman2005nested" role="doc-biblioref">2005</a>)</span>). Some scholars suggest ensuring variation in <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> (most prominently, <span class="citation">King, Keohane, and Verba (<a href="#ref-king1994designing" role="doc-biblioref">1994</a>)</span>), while others have proposed various kinds of matching strategies. Some have pointed to the advantages of random sampling of cases, either stratified or unstratified by values on <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> (<span class="citation">Fearon and Laitin (<a href="#ref-FL2008" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a>)</span>, <span class="citation">Herron and Quinn (<a href="#ref-HerronQuinn" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span>).</p>
<p>Which cases we should choose will likely depend on the purposes to which we want to put them.</p>
<p>A matching strategy for instance—selecting cases that are comparable on many features but that differ on <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>—replicates at a small scale the kind of inference done by matching estimators with large-<span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> data. The strategy draws leverage from <span class="math inline">\(X,Y\)</span> variation rather than from within-case information beyond what is available in the measurement of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>. (FLAG: Citations needed.)</p>
<p>Other treatments seek to use qualitative information to check assumptions made in <span class="math inline">\(X, Y\)</span> analysis: for example, is the measurement of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> reliable in critical cases? (FLAG: Citations needed) For such questions with limited resources, it might make sense to focus on cases for which validation plausibly makes a difference to the <span class="math inline">\(X,Y\)</span> inferences: for example influential cases that have unusually extreme values on <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Similar arguments are made for checking assumptions on selection processes, though we consider this a more complex desideratum since this requires making case level causal inferences and not simply measurement claims.</p>
<p>A third purpose is to use a case to generate alternative or richer theories of causal processes, as in Lieberman’s “model-building” mode of “nested analysis” (<span class="citation">Lieberman (<a href="#ref-Lieberman2005nested" role="doc-biblioref">2005</a>)</span>). Here it may be cases off the regression line that are of interest.</p>
<p>Weller and Barnes (CITE article) on case selection focus on (a) X/Y relations and (b) whether the cases are useful for hypothesis generation.</p>
<p>In what follows, we focus on a simpler goal: given existing <span class="math inline">\(X, Y\)</span> data for a set of cases and a given clue (or set of clues) that we can go looking for in the intensive analysis of some subset of these cases, for which cases would process tracing yield the greatest learning about the population-level causal effect of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>?</p>
<p>The basic insight of this chapter is simple enough: <em>the optimal strategy for case selection for a model-based analysis are a function of the model we start with and the query we seek to address</em>, just as we saw for the optimal clue-selection strategy in Chapter <a href="#Clues"><strong>??</strong></a>. Using this strategy yields guidance that is consistent with some common advice but at odds with other advice. The main principles that emerge from the analysis can be summarized as:</p>
<ul>
<li>go where the probative value is, and</li>
<li>sample from <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> values in proportion to their occurrence in the population,</li>
<li>invest in collections of cases that provide complementary learning.</li>
</ul>
<p>Beyond these general principles, other patterns are more complex and thus more difficult to neatly summarize. The most general message of this chapter is about the general approach: that is, that we can use a causal model to tell us what kinds of cases are likely to yield the greatest learning, given the model and a strategy of inference. We provide a tool for researchers to undertake this analysis, at least for simple problems with <span class="math inline">\(X, Y, K\)</span> data.</p>
<p>Most closely related to our analysis in this chapter is the contribution of <span class="citation">Herron and Quinn (<a href="#ref-HerronQuinn" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span>, who build on <span class="citation">Seawright and Gerring (<a href="#ref-SeawrightGerring2008" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a>)</span>. While Seawright and Gerring provide a taxonomy of approaches to case selection, they do not provide a strategy for assessing the relative merits of these different approaches. As we do, <span class="citation">Herron and Quinn (<a href="#ref-HerronQuinn" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span> focus on a situation with binary <span class="math inline">\(X,Y\)</span> data and assess the gains from learning about causal type in a set of cases (interestingly in their treatment causal type, <span class="math inline">\(Z_i\)</span> is called a confounder rather than being an estimand of direct interest; in our setup, confounding as normally understood arises because of different probabilities of different causal types of being assigned to “treatment”, or an <span class="math inline">\(X=1\)</span> value). <span class="citation">Herron and Quinn (<a href="#ref-HerronQuinn" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span> assume that in any given case selected for analysis a qualitative researcher is able to infer the causal type perfectly.</p>
<p>Our setup differs from that in <span class="citation">Herron and Quinn (<a href="#ref-HerronQuinn" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span> in a few ways. <span class="citation">Herron and Quinn (<a href="#ref-HerronQuinn" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span> paramaterize differently, though this difference is not important.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Perhaps the most important difference between our analysis and that in <span class="citation">Herron and Quinn (<a href="#ref-HerronQuinn" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span> is that we connect the inference strategy to process-tracing approaches. Whereas <span class="citation">Herron and Quinn (<a href="#ref-HerronQuinn" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span> assume that causal types can be read directly, we assume that these are inferred <em>imperfectly</em> from evidence and we endogenize the informativeness of the evidence to features of the inquirys. Moreover, not only can we have uncertainty about the probative value of clues, but researchers can learn about the probative value of clues by examining cases.</p>
<!-- As in our baseline model, our ability to make inferences for causal types can differ by type and as a function of $X$.  -->
<!-- Are Herron and Quinn's priors Jeffrey priors? -->
<p>Here we assume that the case selection decision is made after observing the <span class="math inline">\(XY\)</span> distribution and we explore a range of different possible contingency tables. In <span class="citation">Herron and Quinn (<a href="#ref-HerronQuinn" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span> the distribution from which the contingency tables are drawn is fixed, though set to exhibit an expected observed difference in means (though not necessarily a true treatment effect) of 0.2. They assume large <span class="math inline">\(XY\)</span> data sets (with 10,000) units and case selection strategies ranging from 1 to 20 cases.</p>
<p>Another important difference, is that in many of their analyses, <span class="citation">Herron and Quinn (<a href="#ref-HerronQuinn" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span> take the perspective of an outside analyst who knows the true treatment effect; they then assess the expected bias generated by a research strategy over the possible data realizations. We, instead, take the perspective of a researcher who has <em>beliefs</em> about the true treatment effect that correspond to their priors, and for whom there is therefore no <em>expected</em> bias. This has consequences also for the assessment of expected posterior variance, as in our analyses the expectation of the variance is taken with respect to the researcher’s beliefs about the world, rather than being made conditional on some specific world (ATE). We think that this setup is addressed to the question that a researcher must answer when deciding on a strategy: given what they know now, what will produce the greatest reduction in uncertainty (the lowest expected posterior variance)?</p>
<p>Finally, we proceed somewhat differently in our identification of strategies from Herron and Quinn: rather than pre-specifying particular sets of strategies (operationalizations of those identified by <span class="citation">Seawright and Gerring (<a href="#ref-SeawrightGerring2008" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a>)</span>) and evaluating them, we define a strategy as the particular distribution over <span class="math inline">\(XY\)</span> cells to be examined and proceed to examine <em>every possible strategy</em> given a choice of a certain number of cases in which to conduct process tracing. We thus let the clusters of strategies—those strategies that perform similarly—emerge from the analysis rather than being privileged by past conceptualizations of case-selection strategies.</p>
<p>Despite these various differences, our results will agree in key ways with those in <span class="citation">Herron and Quinn (<a href="#ref-HerronQuinn" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span>.</p>
<div id="no-general-rules" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">14.1.1</span> No general rules</h3>
<p>Case selection is about choosing in which cases to make observations. We obviously want to look for evidence in cases where that evidence is likely to be most informative. And the informativeness of a case depends, in turn, on our model and our query.</p>
<p>Although it might be tempting to seek general case-selection rules of the form “examine cases in which <span class="math inline">\(X=1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y=1\)</span>” or “ignore cases in which <span class="math inline">\(X=0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y=1\)</span>,” it is easily demonstrated that which cases will be (in expectation) more informative depends on models and queries.</p>
<p>Suppose we have observed <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> values for a set of random draw of cases from a population. Suppose further that we know, for this population, that:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(X \rightarrow Y \leftarrow K\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\Pr(Y=1|X=0, K = 0) = 1\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\Pr(Y=1|X=1, K = 0) = .5\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\Pr(Y=1|X=0, K = 1) = 0\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\Pr(Y=1|X=1, K = 1) = .9\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>One way to read this set of statements is that <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>’s causal effect on <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> varies with <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>. We do not know, however how common <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> is. Thus we do not know either the average effect of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> or the probability that <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> caused <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> in a case with particular <span class="math inline">\(X, Y\)</span> values.</p>
<p>What do the above statements tell us about <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>’s <em>informativeness</em>? The beliefs above imply that if, <span class="math inline">\(X=Y=1\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> is a “doubly decisive” clue for assessing whether, in a given case, <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> causes <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>. In particular, we see that for an <span class="math inline">\(X=Y=1\)</span> case, observing <span class="math inline">\(K=1\)</span> implies that <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> caused <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>: this is because, otherwise, <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> would have been 0. We also see that <span class="math inline">\(K=0\)</span>, in an <span class="math inline">\(X=1, Y=1\)</span> case implies that <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> did not cause <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> since <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> would have still been 1 even if <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> were 0. So an <span class="math inline">\(X=Y=1\)</span> case would be a highly informative place to go looking for <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>.</p>
<p>However, if we had a case in which <span class="math inline">\(X=Y=0\)</span>, then learning <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> would be entirely uninformative for the case. In particular, we already <em>know</em> that <span class="math inline">\(K=1\)</span> in this case as the statements above exclude the possibiltiy of a case in which <span class="math inline">\(X=Y=0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(K=0\)</span>. So there would be nothing gained by “looking” to see what <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>’s value is in the case. Moreover, this knowledge is not enough to tell us whether <span class="math inline">\(X=0\)</span> caused <span class="math inline">\(Y=0\)</span>.</p>
<p>For the same reason, we can learn nothing from <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> in an <span class="math inline">\(X=0, Y=1\)</span> case since we know that <span class="math inline">\(K=0\)</span> in such a case. On the other hand, if we chose an <span class="math inline">\(X=1, Y=0\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> would again be doubly decisive, with <span class="math inline">\(K=0\)</span> implying that <span class="math inline">\(X=1\)</span> caused <span class="math inline">\(Y=0\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(K=1\)</span> implying that <span class="math inline">\(X=1\)</span> did not cause <span class="math inline">\(Y=0\)</span>.</p>
<p>We have chosen extreme values for this illustration — our beliefs could, of course, allow for gradations of informativeness, rather than all-or-nothing identification — but the larger point is that beliefs about the way world work can have a powerful effect on the kind of case in which learning is possible. And note that in this example, there is nothing special about where a case lies relative to a (notional) regression line: informativeness in this setup happens to depend on <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>’s value entirely. But, again, this is a particular feature of this particular set of beliefs about the world.</p>
<p>Suppose, now, that we were interested in a population estimand: the average effect of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>. We can see that this is equal to <span class="math inline">\(\Pr(K=1)\times.9 + (1-\Pr(K-0))\times(-.5)) = 1.4\times Pr(K=1)-.5\)</span>. To estimate this estimand, we need only determnine the prevalence of <span class="math inline">\(K=1\)</span> in the population. It might seem that this means that it is irrelevant what type of case we choose: why not use pure random sampling to determine <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>’s prevalence. As noted above, however, we have more information about the likely value of <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> in some kinds of cases than in others. Thus, for this population-level estimand as well, selecting an <span class="math inline">\(X=1\)</span> case will be informative while selecting an <span class="math inline">\(X=0\)</span> case will not be informative.</p>
<p>At the same time, not all <span class="math inline">\(X=1\)</span> cases are equally informative. Should we choose an <span class="math inline">\(X=1\)</span> case in which <span class="math inline">\(Y=1\)</span> or one in which <span class="math inline">\(Y=0\)</span>? In both types of case, <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> is doubly decisive for the probability of causation in the case. However, the two kinds of cases are differentially informative about <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>’s prevalence in the population. For an <span class="math inline">\(X=1, Y=1\)</span> case, we think it moderately likely that <span class="math inline">\(K=1\)</span> (specifically, assuming a prior of <span class="math inline">\(\Pr(K=1)\)</span> we think <span class="math inline">\(\Pr(K=1 | X=1, Y=1) = \frac{.9}{.9+.5}=.64\)</span>). For an <span class="math inline">\(X=1, Y=0\)</span> case, we think <span class="math inline">\(K=1\)</span> is quite unlikely (<span class="math inline">\(\Pr(K=1 | X=1, Y=0) = \frac{.1}{.5+.1}=.17\)</span>). In other words, we are much more uncertain about the value of <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> in the <span class="math inline">\(X=Y=1\)</span> case than in the <span class="math inline">\(X=1, Y=0\)</span> case. In this setup, we would thus expect to learn more about the average treatment effect by choosing to observe <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> in an on-the-diagonal case than in an off-the-diagonal case.</p>
<p>FLAG: What does “assuming a prior of <span class="math inline">\(\Pr(K=1)\)</span>” add to above paragraph?</p>
<p>Specifically, let <span class="math inline">\(\kappa\)</span> denote <span class="math inline">\(\Pr(K=1)\)</span>. Suppose that we begin thinking it equally likely that <span class="math inline">\(\kappa=\kappa^H = .5\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\kappa=\kappa^L=0\)</span>. Suppose, further, that the distribution of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is such that, for any randomly drawn case, <span class="math inline">\(\Pr(X=1) = .5\)</span>. We then observe one case with <span class="math inline">\(X=1, Y=1\)</span> and another with <span class="math inline">\(X=1, Y=0\)</span>. From that information alone, we can update over <span class="math inline">\(\kappa\)</span>. Specifically, conditioning on <span class="math inline">\(X=1\)</span>, when we observe the data pattern, <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>, in which <span class="math inline">\(Y=0\)</span> in one case and <span class="math inline">\(Y=1\)</span> in the other, the posterior on <span class="math inline">\(\kappa\)</span> is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[p(\kappa = \kappa^L|D) =  \frac{p(D|\kappa^H)}{p(D|\kappa^H)+p(D|\kappa^L)}=\frac{.5}{.5 + .25\times(2\times.5\times.5 + 2\times.9\times.1 + 2\times(.9\times.5 +.1\times.5))}\]</span></p>
<p>FLAG: Is the above expression not missing the prior?</p>
<p>FLAG: I am not sure what we’re trying to get out of this expression, so unsure how to tie this up.</p>
<p>In summary, under the stipulated beliefs about the world, we can learn most about the population <span class="math inline">\(ATE\)</span> by selecting an <span class="math inline">\(X=Y=1\)</span> for study. We can also learn about the case-level effect in such a case as well as in an <span class="math inline">\(X=1, Y=0\)</span> case. If we are interested in the case level estimand for any <span class="math inline">\(X=0\)</span> case, then there are no gains from any case-selection strategy since we know <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>’s value based on <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>’s value.</p>
<p>FLAG: AJ: Check my rewrite of last statement.</p>
<p>There is nothing preferable in general about an <span class="math inline">\(X=1\)</span> case. Under a different set of beliefs about the world, we would expect to learn more in an <span class="math inline">\(X=Y=0\)</span> than in an <span class="math inline">\(X=Y=1\)</span> case. Suppose, for instance, that we have a model in which:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(X \rightarrow Y \leftarrow K\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\Pr(Y=1|X=0, K = 0) = .5\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\Pr(Y=1|X=1, K = 0) = 0\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\Pr(Y=1|X=0, K = 1) = .5\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\Pr(Y=1|X=1, K = 1) = 1\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>In this world, we learn nothing from observing a case in which <span class="math inline">\(X=Y=1\)</span>—since we already know that <span class="math inline">\(K=1\)</span>. In contrast, if <span class="math inline">\(X=Y=0\)</span>, then if we learn that <span class="math inline">\(K=1\)</span>, we know that, were <span class="math inline">\(X=1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> would have been 1; and if instead we observe <span class="math inline">\(K=0\)</span>, we know that <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> would have (still) been 0 if <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> were 1. Now, <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> is doubly decisive for an <span class="math inline">\(X=Y=0\)</span> case but unhelpful for an <span class="math inline">\(X=Y=1\)</span> case.</p>
<p>The two off-diagonal cases may also be different in the opportunities for learning that they present. Suppose that you knew that:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(X \rightarrow Y \leftarrow K\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\Pr(Y=1|X=0, K = 0) = 0\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\Pr(Y=1|X=1, K = 0) = .5\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\Pr(Y=1|X=0, K = 1) = 1\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\Pr(Y=1|X=1, K = 1) = .5\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>For an <span class="math inline">\(X=1, Y=0\)</span> case, if you observe <span class="math inline">\(K=1\)</span> you know that if <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> were 0, <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> would have been 1; but if <span class="math inline">\(K=0\)</span>, you know that if <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> were 0, <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> would still have been 0. In that case <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>, would be doubly decisive for <span class="math inline">\(X=1\)</span> causing <span class="math inline">\(Y=0\)</span>. But in an <span class="math inline">\(X=0, Y=1\)</span>, we already know <span class="math inline">\(K=0\)</span> before we go looking.</p>
<p>Say instead that you knew that:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(X \rightarrow Y \leftarrow K\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\Pr(Y=1|X=0, K = 0) = .5\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\Pr(Y=1|X=1, K = 0) = 0\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\Pr(Y=1|X=0, K = 1) = .5\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\Pr(Y=1|X=1, K = 1) = 1\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>It may be better to select a case that is not “like” the cases you want to make inferences about.</p>
<p>FLAG: Not getting the point here. How is this different from the setup two up from here?</p>
</div>
<div id="specific-case-walk-through" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">14.1.2</span> Specific case walk through</h3>
<p>FLAG: AJ: I don’t think this section helps. It basically walks through the chain model results, which we’re already doing in the next section. And it uses a different set of strategies, which will just be confusing. The one thing maybe that’s added here is the table showing the possible data. We could perhaps generate one for illustrative purposes for the four strategies we consider in the sims section.</p>
<p>Consider a situation in which one has access to <span class="math inline">\(X,Y\)</span> data on just six cases of the form:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th align="left">event</th>
<th align="right">count</th>

<td align="right">1</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="left">X1Y1</td>
<td align="right">2</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>We want to examine data on <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> for two of these cases and are wondering about what strategy we should use to select the cases. We are considering three strategies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Strategy <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> chooses two cases on the regression line, one in the <span class="math inline">\(X=Y=0\)</span> cell and one in the <span class="math inline">\(X=Y=1\)</span> cell</li>
<li>Strategy <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> chooses off the regression line, one in the <span class="math inline">\(X=1, Y=0\)</span> cell and one in the <span class="math inline">\(X=0, Y=1\)</span> cell</li>
<li>Strategy <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> selects jointly on the independent and dependent variables, choosing two cases with <span class="math inline">\(X=1, Y = 1\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Different strategies yield different possible types of data. Each one of these is likely to arise with a different probability and is associated with a different inference. Drawing on the prior beliefs embedded in a causal model, we can thus assess the <em>expected</em> posterior variance associated with each strategy.</p>
<p>For each of these possible strategies we can assess the posterior that we would obtain for each type of data we might observe.</p>
<p>The data possibilities, probabilities of each, and inferences given each, are shown in Table <a href="caseselection.html#tab:chselillustration">14.1</a>.</p>
<table>
<caption><span id="tab:chselillustration">Table 14.1: </span>Each column shows a possible distribution of data that can be generated from a given strategy.

From the calculated probability of each data type, given the data seen so far, and the posterior variance given each data realization, the implied <em>expected</em> variance is easily calculated. These are summarized below:</p>

<p>In this example, we see that we would expect to be better off—in the sense of having less posterior uncertainty—by focusing her process-tracing efforts where a greater share of the population of cases lies: on the regression line.</p>
<p>Why is this?</p>
<p>For intuition consider first the case with flat prior data:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>if we examine two cases in different quadrants <em>on the diagonal</em> (one <span class="math inline">\(X=Y=0\)</span> case and one <span class="math inline">\(X=Y=1\)</span> case) :</p>
<ul>
<li>if we find that <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is the same in the two cases then we increase our belief that <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> has no effect at all on <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> and reduce our confidence that <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> had a positive or a negative effect on <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>. Since we are looking on the regression line however, our confidence that <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> had a <em>positive</em> effect on <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is more strongly reduced, producing a posterior centered on a small negative effect.</li>
<li>Conversely if we see that <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is different in the two cases, then we have a correlation of the same sign between both <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> and between <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> cases. We increase our confidence that <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> mattered for <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> in general an din particular that it had a positive effect, resulting in a posterior centered on a small positive ATE.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>if we examine two cases in different quadrants <em>off the diagonal</em> (one <span class="math inline">\(X=0, Y=1\)</span> case and one <span class="math inline">\(X=1, Y=0\)</span> case) :</p>
<ul>
<li>if we find that <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is the same in the two cases then we increase our belief that <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> has no effect at all on <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> and reduce our confidence that <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> had a negative effect <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> (producing a posterior centered on a small positive effect).</li>
<li>Conversely if we see that <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is different in the two cases, then we have a correlation (of different signs) between both <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> and between <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> cases. We increase our confidence that <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> mattered for <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> in general and in particular that it had a negative effect, resulting in a posterior centered on a small negative ATE.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>If we examine data conditioning on the value of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> but with variation on <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> (for instance <span class="math inline">\(X=1, Y=0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(X=1, Y=1\)</span>)
data patterns do not discriminate between X having a positive effect on Y an d X having a negative effect on Y. However variation in <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is more consistent with <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> being responsive to <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and thus the chances that <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> matters, positively or negatively, overall. In teh case with flat data this changes beliefs on positve and negative effects but not the difference between them. The ate then remains unchanged. FLAG work though intuition more</p></li>

data patterns do not discriminate between X having a positive effect on Y an d X having a negative effect on Y. However variation in <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is more consistent with <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> being responsive to <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and thus the chances that <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> matters, positively or negatively, overall. In teh case with flat data this changes beliefs on positve and negative effects but not the difference between them. The ate then remains unchanged.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For correlated data similar logics apply, but the effects are stronger for evidence on the regression line. The reason is that given correlated data we believe there are more units with positive effects than negative effects. When we find evidence against causal relations on the regression line that reduces our confidence for types with positive effects more than for types with negative effects and teh difference between teh shares with positive effects and negative eeffects smaller due to the fact that the beliefs in the shares with negative effects is not so strongly reduced. Wehen we find evidence for causal relations this magnifies teh difference between beliefs in shares positive and shares negatives; these effects are magnified however since our confidence for the positive effects change more than for the negative effects, since we are examining cases on the regression line. Conversely when examining cases of teh regression line, the two forces offset each other.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">14.1.3</span> Case selection from causal models: a simulation-based approach</h3>
<p>We turn now to a more general approach for deriving case-selection guidance from a causal model, given the causal query we wish to address and any data that we have already observed. This approach can be implemented using <code>CausalQueries</code> together with <code>CQTools</code>.</p>
<p>We imagine a situation in which we have already observed some data (the values of some nodes from the causal model in some set of cases) and must now decide in which cases we should gather additional data. To simplify the setup, we will be assuming that we are considering gathering additional observations in cases for which we already have <em>some</em> data. In other words, we are deciding which cases to investigate more <em>deeply</em>. (This is distinct from the question of “wide vs. deep”, where we might decide to observe cases we have not yet seen at all.)</p>
<p>The general intuition of the case-selection approach that we develop here is that we can use our causal model and any previously observed data to estimate what observations we are more or less likely to make under a given case-selection strategy, and then figure out how far off from the (under the model) true estimand we can expect to be under the strategy, given whatever causal question we seek to answer.</p>
<p>We proceed as follows:</p>
<p><strong>DAG</strong>. We start, as always, with a DAG representing our beliefs about which variables we believe to be direct causes of other variables. For the current illustrations, we consider two different DAGS: a simple mediation (or “chain”) model, <span class="math inline">\(X \rightarrow M \rightarrow Y\)</span>, and a two-path model, <span class="math inline">\(X \rightarrow M \rightarrow Y \leftarrow X\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Priors</strong>. As when conducting mixed-method inference, we can set qualitative restrictions and/or differential quantitative weights on the (possibly conditional) nodal types in the model. We can also indicate our uncertainty over the latter, by setting the <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> parameters of the relevant Dirichlet distributions. For the current example, we start by setting flat priors over all nodal types and assume no unobserved confounding.</p>
<p><strong>Given data.</strong> If we have already made observations of any of the model’s nodes in some set of cases, we can use this information to condition our strategy for searching for further information. For instance, if we have observed <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>’s and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>’s value in a set of cases, we might select cases for process tracing based on their values of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and/or <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>. And, importantly, what we have already observed in the cases will affect the inferences we will draw when we observe additional data, including how <em>informative</em> a particular new observation is likely to be. For the present examples, we assume that we have already observed <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> in a set of cases and found a positive correlation.</p>
<p><strong>Query</strong>. We define our query. This could, for instance, be the share of cases in the population in which <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> has a positive effect on <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, or it might be <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>’s average effect on <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>. We can use the general procedure to identify case-selection strategies for any causal query that can be defined on a DAG. And, importantly, the optimal case-selection strategy may depend on the query. For instance, the best case-selection strategy for estimating the average causal effect of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> may not be the same as the best strategy for figuring out for what proportion of the population <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> has a positive effect on <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>. In the example below, we focus on a set of conditional queries, asking what the effect of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is in cases with different <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> values.</p>
<p>FLAG: MAke sure above query definition lines up with what we end up doing.</p>
<p><strong>Define one or more strategies</strong>. A strategy is defined, generically, as the search for data on a given set of <em>nodes</em>, in a given <em>number</em> of cases that are randomly selected <em>conditional</em> on some information we already have about potential cases. Let us assume here that our strategy will involve uncovering <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>’s value in 1 or 2 cases. What we are wondering is how to choose this one or two cases for deeper analysis. For illustrative purposes, we focus in on four possible strategies, conditional on the <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> values that we already know:</p>
<p>1 examine <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> in 1 <span class="math inline">\(X=Y=1\)</span> case;
2 examine <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> in 1 <span class="math inline">\(X=1, Y=0\)</span> case;
3 examine <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> in 2 cases, an <span class="math inline">\(X=Y=1\)</span> and an <span class="math inline">\(X=Y=0\)</span>; and
4 examine <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> in 2 cases, an <span class="math inline">\(X=1, Y=0\)</span> and an <span class="math inline">\(X=0, Y=1\)</span>.</p>
<p>In light of the positive <span class="math inline">\(X,Y\)</span> correlation already observed, we can think of strategies 1 and 3 as “on-the-regression line” strategies, while strategies 2 and 4 are “off-the-regression line” strategies.</p>
<p><strong>Possible data</strong>. For each strategy, there are multiple possible sets of data that we could end up observing. In particular, the data we could end up with will be the <span class="math inline">\(X,Y\)</span> patterns we have already observed plus some pattern of <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> observations. Thus, for instance, for strategy 1, we could end up observing the initial <span class="math inline">\(X,Y\)</span> pattern plus <span class="math inline">\(M=0\)</span> in one of the <span class="math inline">\(X=1, Y=1\)</span> cases, or the initial <span class="math inline">\(X,Y\)</span> pattern plus <span class="math inline">\(M=1\)</span> in one of the <span class="math inline">\(X=1, Y=1\)</span> cases. For strategy 3, we could observe four possible combinations of <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> values, with <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> being 0 or 1 in each of the cases.</p>
<p><strong>Probability of the data</strong>. We now calculate a probability of each possible data realization, given the model and the data that we have already observed. In practice, we do this in <code>CQtools</code> via simulation. Starting with the model together with our priors, we update our beliefs about <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> based on the previously observed data. This posterior now represents our <em>prior</em> for the purposes of the process tracing. In the present example, we are using the already-observed <span class="math inline">\(X,Y\)</span> correlation to update our beliefs about causal-type share allocations in the population, having seen the <span class="math inline">\(X,Y\)</span> data only. We then use this posterior to draw a series of <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> values.</p>
<p>Given that the ambiguity matrix gives us the mapping from causal types to data realizations, we can calculate for each <span class="math inline">\(lambda\)</span> draw the probability of each data possibility given that particular <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> and the strategy. We then average across repeated <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> draws. Since <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>’s are being drawn from our prior, we are automatically weighting more heavily those <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>’s that we believe to be most likely.</p>
<p><strong>Posterior on estimate given the data</strong>. For each data possibility, we can then use <code>CQtools</code> to ask what inference we would get from each data possibility, given whatever query we seek to answer, as well as the variance of that posterior. Examining the inferences from possible data-realizations, as we do below, can help us understand how the learning unfolds for different strategies.</p>
<p><strong>Expected posterior variance under each strategy</strong>. The quantity of ultimate interest is the posterior variance that we expect to end up with under each <em>strategy</em>. Calculating this expectation is now elementary as we have both the posterior variance arising from each data possibility and the probability of each data possibility (given our prior beliefs and the data already observed). The expected posterior variance is simply an average of the posterior variances under each data possibility, weighted by the probability of each data possibility. We can think of the expected gains from a strategy as the expected <em>reduction</em> in posterior variance arising from that strategy.</p>
<p>Complicated as the procedure might seem, it can all be done in code using a single command from the <code>CQtools</code> package.</p>
<p>In Figure <a href="caseselection.html#fig:caseselection">14.1</a>, we examine the informativeness of different process-tracing case-selection strategies by looking at the inferences we would draw for a set of queries depending on what we observe when we delve into the cases.</p>

<p>For the analyses displayed in Figure <a href="caseselection.html#fig:caseselection">14.1</a>, we assume that we have previously observed a positive <span class="math inline">\(X,Y\)</span> correlation in 6 cases: with 4 cases on the regression line, 2 cases off. Now we see what can happen for different queries when we implement each of the four case-selection strategies. The set of queries we are interested in are, what is the effect of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> for:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <span class="math inline">\(ATE\)</span> for the population</li>
<li>the probability of causation in a <span class="math inline">\(X=1, Y=1\)</span> case randomly drawn from the population</li>
<li>the probability of causation in a <span class="math inline">\(X=0, Y=1\)</span> case randomly drawn from the population</li>
</ul>
<p>In the figure, each column represents a single model. Each row represents a query. Within a graph, we plot the inference on the query for all data-realization possibilities for, in turn, an <span class="math inline">\(N=0\)</span> strategy, meaning that we use only the <span class="math inline">\(X,Y\)</span> data and do not process-trace; our two <span class="math inline">\(N=1\)</span> strategies; and our two <span class="math inline">\(N=2\)</span> strategies. In principle each strategy is plotted twice on each graph since it can generate two data patterns.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">14.1.3.1</span> From the <span class="math inline">\(X,Y\)</span> data (Chain model)</h4>
<!-- we see our pure prior on each query before we have seen the $X,Y$ correlation --- i.e., based strictly on the DAG and flat priors over nodal types. The story here is straightforward. We start out believing that, for the $X \rightarrow M$ relationship, the population is evenly divided across the four types, $\theta^M_{00}, \theta^M_{01}, \theta^M_{10}, \theta^M_{11}$ (so 0.25 share of each). Likewise for $\theta^Y$ in relation to the $M \rightarrow Y$ relationship. We can get a positive $X,Y$ effect from a causal type involving $\theta^M_{01}$ and $\theta^Y_{01}$ or from a causal type involving $\theta^M_{10}$ and $\theta^Y_{10}$. Each of those causal types has a 0.125 probability, implying a 0.25 share of positive effects. A mirror-image of that logic gets us to a 0.25 share of negative effects, with the remaining 0.5 of the population comprising causal types that yield null effects (involving either a null effect at one or both steps in the chain). Thus, the expected effect of $X$ on $Y$ for a randomly drawn case from the population, given nothing but the model, is 0.  -->
<!-- Moving across the row, we see our prior beliefs for cases with more specific features. For cases with $X=1, Y=1$, our priors imply a positive effect 25\% of the time.^[This belief arises from a straightforward calculation involving the different combinations of nodal types that could generate $X=1, Y=1$ and their prior probabilities.] As we have flat priors over $M$'s type and its effects on $Y$, conditioning $M$'s value leaves this belief unaffected. By a parallel logic, the model and flat priors imply the belief that 0.25 of all $X=0, Y=1$ cases to involve a negative effect of $X$ on $Y$. -->
<p>We turn first to the chain model. Before examining inferences from data, it is worth noting what a chain model with flat priors implies about the queries of interest. We start out believing that, for the <span class="math inline">\(X \rightarrow M\)</span> relationship, the population is evenly divided across the four types, <span class="math inline">\(\theta^M_{00}, \theta^M_{01}, \theta^M_{10}, \theta^M_{11}\)</span> (so 0.25 share of each). Likewise for <span class="math inline">\(\theta^Y\)</span> in relation to the <span class="math inline">\(M \rightarrow Y\)</span> relationship. We can get a positive <span class="math inline">\(X,Y\)</span> effect from a causal type involving <span class="math inline">\(\theta^M_{01}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\theta^Y_{01}\)</span> or from a causal type involving <span class="math inline">\(\theta^M_{10}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\theta^Y_{10}\)</span>. Each of those causal types has a 0.125 probability, implying a 0.25 share of positive effects. A mirror-image of that logic gets us to a 0.25 share of negative effects, with the remaining 0.5 of the population comprising causal types that yield null effects (involving either a null effect at one or both steps in the chain). Thus, the average effect of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, given nothing but the model, is 0. Moreover, for an <span class="math inline">\(X=1, Y=1\)</span> case, the probability of a (positive) causal effect is also 0.25, as it is for a negative effect in an <span class="math inline">\(X=0, Y=1\)</span> case.</p>
<p>Now, we introduce data. In the <span class="math inline">\(N=0\)</span> column of each graph, we see our inferences from the initial set of 6 <span class="math inline">\(X,Y\)</span> observations. In this model, as there is no confounding, a positive <span class="math inline">\(X,Y\)</span> correlation is evidence of a higher relative share of cases in which <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> has a positive effect on <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>. This implies a positive treatment effect as well as a greater than 0.25 chance of causation for an <span class="math inline">\(X=1, Y=1\)</span> case since the <span class="math inline">\(X,Y\)</span> pattern suggests that there are more cases where <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> has a positive effect on <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> than there are cases in which <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is fixed at 1.</p>
<p>Notably, however, our beliefs for an <span class="math inline">\(X=0, Y=1\)</span> case are unaffected by observing the positive correlation. To return for a moment to our handy <span class="math inline">\(a,b,c,d\)</span> typology, the reason is that the positive <span class="math inline">\(X,Y\)</span> correlation affects our beliefs about the share of <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> types relative to <span class="math inline">\(a,c,\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> types (with reference to the overall <span class="math inline">\(X rightarrow Y\)</span> effect), but it is uninformative about the relative shares of <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> vs. <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> types, the two types in contention for an <span class="math inline">\(X=0, Y=1\)</span> case. In the <span class="math inline">\(X,Y\)</span> data, the <span class="math inline">\(X=0, Y=1\)</span> case is equally likely to be an <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> or a <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>, which is exactly what our prior belief was about a random <span class="math inline">\(X=0, Y=1\)</span> case.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>FLAG: Stuff above on N=0 needs adjustment once we’ve figured out how the XY correlation affects things.</p>
<!-- (Again, conditioning on $M$'s value has no effect since we still have no information to shift us off our flat priors relating to $M$'s causes or effects.) -->

<h4><span class="header-section-number">14.1.3.2</span> <span class="math inline">\(N=1\)</span> strategies (Chain model)</h4>
<p>Now, what can we learn by selecting a single case for process tracing, that is, the observation of the additional clue, <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> in one of the 6 cases on which we already have <span class="math inline">\(X,Y\)</span> data? We can see along the <span class="math inline">\(N=1\)</span> vertical in each graph how our beliefs shift for each query depending on what value of <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> we observe for two case-selection strategies: selecting a case <em>on</em> the regression line (an <span class="math inline">\(X=Y=1\)</span> case) or selecting a case <em>off</em> the regression line (an <span class="math inline">\(X=1, Y=0\)</span> case).</p>
<p>The lesson here is a simple one: under this model, an <span class="math inline">\(N=1\)</span> strategy delivers no learning about the <span class="math inline">\(ATE\)</span> or probability of causation, <em>regardless</em> of which type of case we choose. To see why, let’s first consider the on-the-line strategy. Not having observed <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> previously, we still have flat priors over the nodal types governing <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>’s effect on <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>’s effect on <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>. That is to say, we still have no idea whether <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>’s positive effect on <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> (where present) more commonly operates through a chain of positive effects or a chain of negative effects. Thus, the observation of, say, <span class="math inline">\(M=1\)</span> in an <span class="math inline">\(X=1, Y=1\)</span> case is equally consistent with a positive <span class="math inline">\(X \rightarrow Y\)</span> (to the extent that effect operates via linked positive effects) and with no <span class="math inline">\(X \rightarrow Y\)</span> effect (to the extent positive effects operate through linked negative effects). Observing <span class="math inline">\(M=1\)</span> in an <span class="math inline">\(X=1, Y=1\)</span> case therefore tells us nothing about the causal effect in that case and, thus, nothing about the average effect either.</p>
<p>Similarly, we have no idea whether <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>’s negative effect on <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> (where present) operates through a positive-negative chain or a negative-positive chain, making <span class="math inline">\(M=1\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(M=0\)</span> in an <span class="math inline">\(X=1, Y=0\)</span> case both equally consistent with a negative or null <span class="math inline">\(X \rightarrow Y\)</span> effect, yielding no information about causation in the case. By a similar logic, observing <span class="math inline">\(M=1\)</span> in the <span class="math inline">\(X=1, Y=1\)</span> case is uninformative about negative effects in an <span class="math inline">\(X=0, Y=1\)</span> case, and observing <span class="math inline">\(M=1\)</span> in an <span class="math inline">\(X=1, Y=0\)</span> case tells us nothing about positive effects in an <span class="math inline">\(X=1, Y=1\)</span> case.</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">14.1.3.3</span> <span class="math inline">\(N=2\)</span> Strategies (Chain model)</h4>
<p>Next, we consider the process tracing of <em>two</em> of our cases. Now, because we are observing <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> in two cases, we can learn from the variation in <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> across these cases—or, more specifically, from its covariation with <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> aand with <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>. In other words, there is a critical difference between process tracing one case and process tracing two cases. When we only process trace one case in a setup like this one, we do not learn about causal effects in the cases we process-trace because we have no information about intermediate causal effects (e.g., whether they are more likely positive or negative). Thus, while we have pointed out that observing <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> within a case can lend <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> probative value for <em>other</em> cases in which we might choose to observe <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> has no probative value <em>for</em> that one case. In contrast, if we observe <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> in two or more cases, we <em>do</em> learn about causal effects for those cases because of the leverage provided by observing covariation between the process-tracing clue and other variables.</p>
<p>We consider first, in the 5th row, a situation in which we look at <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> in two on-the-line cases, an <span class="math inline">\(X=Y=0\)</span> case and an <span class="math inline">\(X=Y=1\)</span> case, and where we observe <span class="math inline">\(M=0\)</span> in the first case and <span class="math inline">\(M=1\)</span> in the second case. What we are seeing, then, is that <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> covaries with both <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>. Seeing that the mediator covaries across cases with both the cause and the outcome is evidence of a causal effect of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>. Since the observed pattern covariation is consistent with a positive effect (linked positive effects), our belief about the unconditional effect of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> goes up. For the same reason, so too does our belief about the causal effect conditional on <span class="math inline">\(X=1, Y=1\)</span>.</p>
<p>We see an even bigger boost in our estimate of the effect in an <span class="math inline">\(X=1, Y=1\)</span> case conditional on <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> also being 1. Two things are generating this upward updating. First, just as for the unconditional estimate and the estimate conditional on <span class="math inline">\(X=1, Y=1\)</span>, the process tracing generates a stronger belief that <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> generally has a positive effect on <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>. Second, as for the <span class="math inline">\(N=1\)</span> process tracing, seeing <span class="math inline">\(M=1\)</span> in two on-the-line cases (which we already believe are mostly positive-effect cases) makes <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> informative as a clue in favor of a positive effect—indeed, more informative than if we’d only seen <span class="math inline">\(M=1\)</span> in one on-the-line case.</p>
<p>Moving across the columns, we also see that process-tracing the on-the-line cases and finding evidence consistent with positive effects in those cases leads us to update in favor of <em>negative</em> effects as well, conditional on <span class="math inline">\(X=0, Y=1\)</span> (including conditional on <span class="math inline">\(M=1\)</span>). Why is that?</p>
<p>Our answer is somewhat speculative, but we think there are two things going on. One is simply that the correlations between <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and between <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> across the two process-traced cases constitutes evidence of <em>effects</em>, period, at the intervening steps—a necessary condition for <em>any</em> <span class="math inline">\(X \rightarrow Y\)</span> effect, positive or negative. So, for an <span class="math inline">\(X=0, Y=1\)</span> case, a stronger belief that <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> has some effect on <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> and that <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> has some effect on <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> implies a strong belief in a negative <span class="math inline">\(X \rightarrow Y\)</span> effect.</p>
<p>The second thing that is probably going on is constraint imposed by prior beliefs. Having seen the <span class="math inline">\(X,Y\)</span> data, we have previously formed a belief that the <em>average</em> effect of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is 0.05. When we find evidence in favor of positive effects, we update to a set of beliefs that are a compromise between the new data and prior beliefs. On the one hand, we upwardly update on the unconditional <span class="math inline">\(X \rightarrow Y\)</span> effect. On the other hand, our beliefs are constrained from moving <em>too</em> far away from an unconditional effect of 0.05. Recall that, in a binary setting, the average effect in a population is the share of cases with positive effects minus the share with negative effects. Thus, the conservative influence of our priors means that, as we upwardly update on positive effects, we also upwardly update our beliefs about the prevalence of <em>negative</em> effects, though not by as much, with the result that our beliefs about the unconditional effect do not shift as much as they would if we had had flat priors. By anchoring our beliefs about average effects, then, the prior <span class="math inline">\(X,Y\)</span> evidence means that any evidence in favor of positive effects also constitutes evidence in favor of negative effects.</p>
<p>To put this point another way, while we learn <em>directly</em> about positive effects from process-tracing the on-the-line cases since these are cases in which positive effects can possible occur. And we then learn <em>indirectly</em> about negative effects from these cases <em>via</em> the prior-imposed constraint on the average effect.</p>
<p>Now, supppose we chose the same case-selection strategy—we examine two on-the-line cases, from opposite cells—but instead of observing <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> covary with <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(M=1\)</span> in both cases. We see the results in the 6th row. This data-realization, under the same strategy, represents clear evidence <em>against</em> positive effects, while also counting against <em>any</em> effects. We have observed that <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is unresponsive to changes in <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, and that <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> varies without <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> varying—null effects at both stages of the chain. Now we see that our posterior on the unconditional effect drops to 0, and we see a sharp movement toward zero conditional on <span class="math inline">\(X=1, Y=1\)</span>, representing our updated belief that there are few positive effects. Interestingly, whereas conditioning additionally on <span class="math inline">\(M=1\)</span> generated in a <em>higher</em> estimated effect when we observed <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> correlated with <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, it generates a <em>lower</em> estimated effect when we observe <span class="math inline">\(M=1\)</span> in both cases. One reason is likely that we have updated our belief about <span class="math inline">\(\theta^M\)</span> such that we now believe that <span class="math inline">\(X=1, M=1\)</span> cases are more likely to be <span class="math inline">\(\theta^M_{11}\)</span>’s (no effect) than <span class="math inline">\(\theta^M_{01}\)</span>’s. We have not similarly updated with respect to <span class="math inline">\(X=1, M=0\)</span> cases and the <span class="math inline">\(\theta^M_{00}\)</span>’s than <span class="math inline">\(\theta^M_{10}\)</span> shares. Thus, for an <span class="math inline">\(X=1,Y=1\)</span> case, additionally specifying that <span class="math inline">\(M=1\)</span> implies an even higher likelihood that the case contains a null effect.</p>
<p>For <span class="math inline">\(X=0, Y=1\)</span> cases, we see similar movements toward zero, reflecting the fact the <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> pattern speaks against any effects. And, again, the movement is stronger when we condition on <span class="math inline">\(M=1\)</span>.</p>
<p>Finally, we consider an off-the-line <span class="math inline">\(N=2\)</span> strategy and two possible data-realizations under that strategy. We select for process tracing one <span class="math inline">\(X=1, Y=0\)</span> case and one <span class="math inline">\(X=0, Y=1\)</span> case. The two possible data-realizations we consisder are that <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> varies positively with <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> across the two cases (7th row) or that <span class="math inline">\(M=1\)</span> in both cases (8th row). One thing we can observe immediately is that we get less leverage from this strategy: across all columns, the difference in our posterior beliefs between the two data-realizations is smaller than it is for the two data-realizations of the on-the-line strategy. For instance, while we see <span class="math inline">\(0.08\)</span> swing in the unconditional effect under the on-the-line strategy, we see only a <span class="math inline">\(0.02\)</span> swing under the off-the-line strategy.</p>
<p>Unpacking this further, we know that we can learn directly about <em>negative</em> <span class="math inline">\(X \rightarrow Y\)</span> effects through process-tracing off-the-line cases. If we see <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> covary positively with <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> across these two cases—which also means covarying negatively with <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>—we have found evidence in favor of the operation of negative <span class="math inline">\(X \rightarrow Y\)</span> effects. Hence the movement in our posterior away from 0 when we condition on <span class="math inline">\(X=0, Y=1\)</span>. We also see updating away from zero for positive effects (conditioning on <span class="math inline">\(X=1, Y=1\)</span>), though by a smaller amount (using the <span class="math inline">\(X,Y\)</span>-data only as our baseline). Again, some of this movement is likely attributable to the constraint imposed by the prior generated from the <span class="math inline">\(X,Y\)</span> data. Some of this updating is also likely attributable to the fact that we have found evidence against null intermediate effects.</p>
<p>Curiously, under this strategy and data-realization, our beliefs about effects conditional on <span class="math inline">\(X=0, M=1, Y=1\)</span> move in the <em>opposite</em> direction from our beliefs conditional just on <span class="math inline">\(X=0,Y=1\)</span>. Why might this be? This is likely because of the way in which the process-tracing has lent probative value to <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>. The pattern of <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> data is most consistent with any negative <span class="math inline">\(X \rightarrow Y\)</span> effect operating via a <em>positive</em> <span class="math inline">\(X \rightarrow M\)</span> effect followed by a <em>negative</em> <span class="math inline">\(M \rightarrow Y\)</span> effect. Yet the intermediate effects would have to have the opposite sign for <span class="math inline">\(X=0, M=1, Y=1\)</span> to be consistent with an <span class="math inline">\(X \rightarrow Y\)</span> effect. In other words, <span class="math inline">\(M=1\)</span> rules out the likeliest way in which an <span class="math inline">\(X=0, Y=1\)</span> case could contain an effect.</p>
<p>If on the other hand we observe <span class="math inline">\(M=1\)</span> in both off-the-line cases, we have found “direct” evidence against the operation of negative effects. Hence the the strong movement of our posterior toward 0 for effects conditional on <span class="math inline">\(X=0, Y=1\)</span> and, even more so, if also conditioning on <span class="math inline">\(M=1\)</span> (since we now have evidence that <span class="math inline">\(M=1\)</span> cases are more likely <span class="math inline">\(\theta^M_{11}\)</span>’s than <span class="math inline">\(\theta^M_{01}\)</span>’s). Likewise, we see upward movement in our posterior on the unconditional effect and, for reasons discussed earlier, in our posterior on positive effects (conditioning on <span class="math inline">\(X=1, Y=1\)</span>).</p>
<p>The remaining puzzle is why the learning from the off-the-line strategy is weaker than the learning from the on-the-line strategy. Both strategies generate symmetrical opportunities to observe an <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> pattern that is consistent or inconsistent with causal effects. We believe there are two reasons, both relating to the fact that we learn “directly” about positive effects from the on-the-line strategy (and “indirectly” about negative effects) and that we learn “directly” about negative effects (and “indirectly” about positive effects) from the off-the-line strategy.</p>
<p>The first, more mechanical reason is that we start, given the <span class="math inline">\(X,Y\)</span> data, with a higher and higher-variance posterior on the prevalence of positive effects as compared to negative effects. So there is simply more scope for the data to influence our beliefs about positive effects, and the on-the-line cases are those in which we can learn “directly” about positive effects. Note, for instance, the <span class="math inline">\(0.17\)</span> differential in beliefs about effects conditional on <span class="math inline">\(X=1, Y=1\)</span> depending on what we observe under the on-the-line strategy, as compared to the <span class="math inline">\(0.1\)</span> differential for effects conditional on <span class="math inline">\(X=0, Y=1\)</span> under the off-the-line strategy.</p>
<p>The second reason is prevalence: given the <span class="math inline">\(X,Y\)</span> correlation, we believe that there are more cases out there that potentially contain positive effects than there are cases that potentially contain negative effects. Thus, <em>whatever</em> it is we learn about positive effects is going to have a bigger impact on our beliefs about the population as a whole than is whatever we learn about negative effects. Since on-the-line case yield the most direct learning about positive effects, they are therefore the most informative about the population.</p>
<p>Note, importantly, that this finding is consistent with recommendations in the literature to investigate on-the-line cases (<span class="citation">Lieberman (<a href="#ref-Lieberman2005nested" role="doc-biblioref">2005</a>)</span>, <span class="citation">Goertz (<a href="#ref-goertz2017multimethod" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span>).<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Yet, the reason is very different. Lieberman and Goertz emphasize the importance of examining cases where the theorized mechanism connecting <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> might potentially play out, arguing that this would be in the set of cases that conform to theory in their <span class="math inline">\(X,Y\)</span> values. We would emphasize that, in the causal-model framework, one <em>can</em> learn about both overall effects and intermediate effects from off-the-line cases. The reason why on-the-line cases is simply that they are more <em>representative</em> about the universe about which we aim to learn (assuming we want to learn about the population from which the <span class="math inline">\(X,Y\)</span> pattern is drawn).</p>

<div id="two-path-model" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">14.1.3.4</span> Two-path model</h4>
<p>Case-selection strategies depend on the model. To see this, consider the results of the same analysis conducted for a two-path model in which <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> can have both an indirect effect on <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> via <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> and a direct effect on <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>. We first examine a version with flat priors over all nodal types and then a version in which we impose some monotonicity restrictions.</p>
<p>In Table XXXXXX, we see the results of the case-selection exercise for a two-path model with flat priors. The takeaway here is simple: it does not matter what kind of case(s) we choose for process-tracing because nothing can be learned from observing <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>. We learn about effects from the <span class="math inline">\(X,Y\)</span> data. But, after that, adding observations <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> yields no change in beliefs. The reason, we think, is the combination of the double pathway and uninformtativeness of priors. We go in with a flat distribution across nodal types <span class="math inline">\(\theta^M\)</span> and nodal types <span class="math inline">\(\theta^Y\)</span>. We then acquire some information on the <span class="math inline">\(X \rightarrow Y\)</span> effect from the <span class="math inline">\(X,Y\)</span> data, but those effects are equally consistent with all possible pathways—direct, indirect, or combined. Suppose we then find evidence that cuts against the operation of the indirect pathway: <span class="math inline">\(M=1\)</span> is observed in two on-the-line cases with different <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> values. So we downgrade the probability of <span class="math inline">\(\theta^M_{01}\)</span> relative to <span class="math inline">\(\theta^M_{11}\)</span>. However, we are still able to preserve our prior on the effect of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> (whether conditional or unconditional) by updating our beliefs about <span class="math inline">\(\theta^Y\)</span> in a manner that places greater weight on direct effects. To put the point in the language of levels of theory: high flexibility in our lower-level beliefs impedes learning about higher-level quantities from observations at the lower level. This is true regardless of which quadrants we select our cases from.</p>
<p>The situation changes, however, if we come in with informative beliefs at the lower level. In Table XXXXXXX, we see results for a two-path model with restrictions, such that negative <span class="math inline">\(X \rightarrow M\)</span> and negative <span class="math inline">\(M \rightarrow Y\)</span> effects are ruled out.</p>
<p>FLAG: Cannot yet see why we learn more from the restricted 2-path model than from the flat 2-path. Yes, we can learn from n=1 about the indirect path. But in both cases, we can still have compensating updating on the direct path for anything we learn about the indirect path. In fact, the prior probability of positive effects on each path is very similar across the two models. Ignoring interactions, for indirect path, b share is like 1/8 in flat model, and 1/9 in restricted, vs. 1/4 for direct path. Is it just that the learning about the indirect path is stronger with restricted priors because M starts out as informative about the indirect path? So the learning about the indirect path more easily swamps the prior?</p>
<p>FLAG: Incorporate as needed above and below any implications of Jeffreys priors.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">14.2</span> Wide or Deep</h2>
<p>We continue our journey through the space of research-design choices. Suppose, now, that we have identified those clues that will be most informative, given our beliefs about the world. A further question that we face is the quintessential dilemma of <em>mixing</em> methods: what mixture of quantitative and qualitative evidence is optimal? We have, of course, argued in in Chapter (mixing) that the distinction between quantitative and qualitative inference is, in a causal-model framework, without much of a difference. But here we are framing a more precise question: given finite resources, how should we trade off between studying a larger number of cases and drilling down to learn more about some subset of the cases in our sample? How should we decide between going “wide” and going “deep”?</p>
<p>Just as with the selection of clues and cases, how much we should expect to learn from going wide versus going deep will <em>depend</em> on how we think the world works. In this chapter, we separate out two forms that these prior beliefs might take: the structural causal model with which we start the analysis and any data that we have seen at the point of making the wide-versus-deep decision. As we will see, the expected opportunities for learning about different causal estimands depends greatly on both of these.</p>
<p>We examine here both queries commonly associated with extensive, quantitative strategies of analysis (such as average treatment effects) and queries commonly associated with more intensive, qualitative approaches (queries about causal pathways and about causal effects at the case level). The analysis in this chapter makes clear the opportunities for integration across these lines of inquiry. We show that investing in-depth process tracing will sometimes make sense even when one aims to learn about average effects in a population. Likewise, collecting <span class="math inline">\(X, Y\)</span> data can sometimes help us draw inferences that will aid in case-level explanation. Particular kinds of case-level information can teach us about populations, and understanding population-level patterns can help us get individual cases right.</p>
<div id="specific-case-walk-through-1" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">14.2.1</span> Specific case walk through</h3>
<p>To build up our intuitions about how the optimal mix of strategies might depend on how the world works, let us explore a simple example. We focus here on the question of how much we can learn from drilling deeper, given an initial set of <span class="math inline">\(X,Y\)</span> data and beliefs about the world.</p>
<p>Imagine a world in which we have lots of data on <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> (2000 observations) and we see <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> are perfectly correlated. We might be tempted to infer that <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> causes <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> surely. If <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> were randomly assigned then we might be able to justify that inference. Say however that our data is observational and in particular we were aware of an observed confound (gender say) that might determine both <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, then what are we to infer? In that case the effect of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is not identified. As shown by <span class="citation">Manski (<a href="#ref-manski1995identification" role="doc-biblioref">1995</a>)</span>, different priors could support beliefs anywhere between 0 and 1. From <span class="citation">Pearl (<a href="#ref-pearl2009causality" role="doc-biblioref">2009</a>)</span> we know that if the right model is <span class="math inline">\(X \rightarrow Y \leftarrow M \rightarrow X\)</span> then if we had data on <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> the effect of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> would be identified. We could essentially find the effect of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> for men and women and take the average effect.</p>
<p>Say though that we had a choice between gathering a lot <em>more</em> data on <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> or gathering a <em>little</em> data on <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> for a subset of cases—just 20 in this illustration. Which should we do? Is 20 cases enough to probe the causal model to see whether the correlation between <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is spurious or not?</p>
<p>We get an intuition for the answer by imagining the inferences we might draw in 3 extreme cases and compare these to the base case. Figure <a href="caseselection.html#fig:widedeepXYMX">14.3</a> illustrates. The figures are generated by forming a model with <span class="math inline">\(X\rightarrow Y \leftarrow M \rightarrow Y\)</span> strong priors that <span class="math inline">\(\Pr(M=1)=0.5\)</span> and flat priors otherwise. Thus in our priors we think that <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is equally likely to be a 0 or 1 but do not make assumptions about how it is related to <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>. We then update the model with the base data and then with the base data combined with three types of additional data.</p>

</div>
<p>The first panel in Figure <a href="caseselection.html#fig:widedeepXYMX">14.3</a> shows our posterior distributions over the average effect from observation of the base data: 2000 cases with <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> perfectly correlated. The distribution is quite wide given that the data is perfectly correlated. The reason is that the posterior includes our uncertainty over the nature of confounding. Our estimate for the ATE is 0.86 but with posterior standard deviation of 0.1519. We have positive weight on all positive value of the ATE.</p>
<p>The second panel shows inferences in the case in which we have twice as many data points and the new points also display a perfect <span class="math inline">\(X,Y\)</span> correlation—like the first set. We coudldn’t imagine data that more strongly confirms a positive relation. The main thing to note here however is that investing in gathering data on 2000 additional points does not help us very much.
Our estimate for the ATE is 0.88 but with posterior standard deviation of 0.1497. So the changes are slight.</p>
<p>The third panel shows inferences in the case in which we again keep the number of cases fixed but now examine data on <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> for 20 cases. In this example we imagine that <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is uncorrelated with both <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>. Our estimate for the ATE is 0.98 but with posterior standard deviation of 0.004. The few cases we have are enough to convince us that the <span class="math inline">\(X,Y\)</span> relationship is not spurious.</p>
<p>Note also that the same confidence can not be generated simply by updating on the 20 datapoints for which we have full <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> data—were we to use only the subset with complete data our estimate for the ATE is 0.26 but a large posterior standard deviation of 0.1218.</p>
<p>The fourth panel shows inferences in the case in which we keep the number of cases fixed but now examine data on <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> for 20 cases. In this example we imagine that <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is also perfectly correlated with <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>. Our estimate for the ATE is 0.79 but with posterior standard deviation of 0.1632.</p>
<p>The lessons in this example are quite stark: in some settings, such as when there is confounding, going wide can stop aiding inference. More data of the same form does not change beliefs. However, going deep—even if only in a few cases—can add more valuable and help us figure out whether the patterns we are seeing in the wide data reflect real relations or not.</p>

<p>Figure <a href="caseselection.html#fig:morn1">14.4</a> shows the <em>distribution</em> of posterior variances we might obtain from many possible data draws, where each data draw is based on our current beliefs about the world. In this example we compare strategies with 800 and 1600 data points on <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> and with 0 and 100 data points on <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>. We see here that the expected variance is lower when new data on <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is sought — more data on <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> does not add much in expectation. This is consistent with the analysis above with the important difference that hte strategy we use here does not depend on the specification of a particular dataset but can be applied to <em>any</em> model, with <em>any</em> query, and <em>any</em> prior data.</p>

<li id="fn2"><p><span class="citation">Herron and Quinn (<a href="#ref-HerronQuinn" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span> have a parameter <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> that governs the distribution of data over <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> and then, conditional on <span class="math inline">\(X,Y\)</span> values, a set of parameters <span class="math inline">\(\psi_{xy}\)</span> that describe the probability of a case’s being of a given causal type. We take both <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\psi_{xy}\)</span> to derive from the fundamental distribution of causal types and assignment probabilities. Thus, for example, <span class="math inline">\(\psi_{00}\)</span> from <span class="citation">Herron and Quinn (<a href="#ref-HerronQuinn" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span> corresponds to <span class="math inline">\(\frac{(1-\pi_b)\lambda_b}{(1-\pi_b)\lambda_b + (1-\pi_c)\lambda_c}\)</span> in our notation. The difference in paramaterization does have implications for interpretations of the priors. For example flat priors over <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\psi\)</span> implies a tighter distribution that a uniform prior over the causal types. In fact <span class="citation">Herron and Quinn (<a href="#ref-HerronQuinn" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span> use priors with greater variance than uniform in any event.<a href="caseselection.html#fnref2" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn3"><p>The <span class="math inline">\(N=2\)</span> strategies can generate 4 data possibilities, but we group these into two categories: <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> varies across the cases or <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is constant across the cases.<a href="caseselection.html#fnref3" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn4"><p>Put differently, the observed <span class="math inline">\(X,Y\)</span> correlation is equally consistent with all <span class="math inline">\(X=0, Y=1\)</span> cases being <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>’s, with them all being <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>’s, or with anything in between.<a href="caseselection.html#fnref4" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn5"><p>We set aside here Lieberman’s recommendation to choose off-the-line cases for discovery-oriented “model-building” because we see that enterprise as distinct from the estimation endeavor to which our analysis is oriented.<a href="caseselection.html#fnref5" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
