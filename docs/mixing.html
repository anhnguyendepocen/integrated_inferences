<p>We extend the analysis of Chapter <a href="pt.html#pt">7</a> to cases with population data. In these cases we get to learn about the distribution of causal effects and are able to update the models we use for case level inference.</p>
</div>
<p><br></p>
<p>The main goal of this chapter is to generalize the model developed in Chapter <a href="pt.html#pt">7</a> to research situations in which we have data on multiple cases.</p>
<p>We start with a conceptual point: the structure introduced in Chapter 6 for single case analysis can be used <em>as is</em> for multi-case analysis. Thus the conceptual work for mixed methods inference from models has been done already. Our goal for the rest of the chapter is more technical—to show how to exploit assumptions regarding independence across cases to generate simpler models of causal processes that affect many units. As we do so, we provide microfoundations for the models in Chapter 6 (as with those in <span class="citation"><a href="references.html#ref-humphreys2015mixing" role="doc-biblioref">Humphreys and Jacobs</a> (<a href="references.html#ref-humphreys2015mixing" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span>) with the probative value of clues deriverable from a causal structure and data rather than provided directly by researchers.</p>
<div id="theres-only-ever-one-case" class="section level2" number="9.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">9.1</span> There’s only ever one case</h2>
<p>Conceptualized correctly, there is no deep difference between the logic of inference used in single case and many case studies. The reason is not, as <span class="citation"><a href="references.html#ref-king1994designing" role="doc-biblioref">King, Keohane, and Verba</a> (<a href="references.html#ref-king1994designing" role="doc-biblioref">1994</a>)</span> suggest, that all causal inference is fundamentally correlational, even in seemingly single case studies. Nor is the point that single “case studies” can be disaggregated into many cases. The intuition, we think, really runs in the opposite direction: fundamentally, model-based inference always involves comparing <em>a</em> pattern of data with the logic of the model. Studies with multiple cases can be conceptualized as single-case studies: the drawing of inferences from a single <em>collection</em> of clues.</p>
<p>In practice, when we move from a causal model with one observation to a causal model with multiple observations, we can use the structure we introduced in Chapter 6 but simply replace nodes that have a single value (i.e., scalars) with nodes containing multiple values (i.e., vectors). We then make inferences about the relations between vectors from seeing the values of those vectors, or other vectors that serve as clues.</p>
<p>To illustrate, consider the following situation. There are two units studied, drawn from some population, a binary treatment <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is assigned independently with probability .5 to each case; an outcome <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> along with clue variable <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> is observable. We suppose <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> can affect <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> and in addition there is a background, unobserved, variable <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> (causal type) that takes on values in <span class="math inline">\(\{a,b,c,d\}\)</span>, with equal probability and that affects both <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> (we interpret <span class="math inline">\(\{a,b,c,d\}\)</span> as introduced in section <a href="models.html#counterfactualmodel">2.1</a>). In particular we suppose that in any given case <span class="math inline">\(K=1\)</span> whenever <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> causes <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(K=1\)</span> with a 50% probability otherwise. Thus, <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> is informative about a unit’s causal type.</p>
<p>Note that we have described the problem at the unit level. However we can redescribe it at the population level thus:</p>
<ul>
<li>a treatment vector <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> can take on one of four values, <span class="math inline">\((0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)\)</span> with equal probability (or more strictly: as determined by <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>).</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> is also a vector with two elements that can take on one of 16 values <span class="math inline">\((a,a), (a,b),\dots (d,d)\)</span> as determined by <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_\theta\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> has the same domain as <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, and element <span class="math inline">\(K[j]=1\)</span> if <span class="math inline">\(\theta[j]=b\)</span>.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is a vector that reflects the elements of <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> in the obvious way (e.g <span class="math inline">\(X=(0,0), \theta=(a,b)\)</span> generates outcomes <span class="math inline">\(Y=(1,0)\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Say we are interested in the Sample Average Treatment Effect. We will consider three counterfactual possibilities. In one, both units have <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> forced to 0. In the other two one unit has <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> set to 0 and the other has <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> set to 1. Thus we are interested in the average effect of changing one unit to treatment while the other is held in control. Note also that before our estimands were binary—of the form: is it a <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> type?–and our answer was a probability; now our estimand is categorical and our answer is a distribution (what is the probability the SATE is 0, what is the probability the SATE is .5, and so on).</p>
<p>We now have a representation that maps directly onto the case level structures used in Chapters 6 and 7 and can use the tools introduced there to analyze this seemingly multi-case study.</p>
<p>Our prior on the probability that <span class="math inline">\(\tau=1\)</span> is the prior that <span class="math inline">\(\theta = (b,b)\)</span>: just 1 in 16. Say we observe that for both units <span class="math inline">\(X=1, Y=1\)</span>. This data pattern is consistent with vectors <span class="math inline">\((b,b), (d,d), (b, d), (d,b)\)</span> only and so our beliefs that <span class="math inline">\(\tau=1\)</span> now shifts to 1 in 4 rather than 1 in 16. Say we then observe data pattern <span class="math inline">\(K = (1,1)\)</span>, the probability of this pattern if <span class="math inline">\(\tau = 1\)</span> is 1. For the type vectors <span class="math inline">\((d,d), (b, d), (d,b)\)</span> it is <span class="math inline">\(.25, .5, .5\)</span>, respectively. Applying Bayes rule, our updated belief that <span class="math inline">\(\tau = 1\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(1/(1 + .25 + .5 + .5) = 4/9\)</span>. We can similarly figure out the posteriors over all values for <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> given any vector-valued clue and so build up a full posterior distributions.
Thus if observe data pattern <span class="math inline">\(K = (0,1)\)</span>, the probability of this pattern for type vector <span class="math inline">\((b,b)\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(\tau = 1\)</span>) is 0. For the type vectors <span class="math inline">\((d,d), (b, d), (d,b)\)</span> it is <span class="math inline">\(.25, 0, .5\)</span>, respectively. The table below shows the posterior distribution on the average treatment effects given different <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> patterns observed.</p>

<p>The conceptual point here is that the general procedure with multiple units is the same as with one unit; in this case we have to work out the likelihood of each data <em>pattern</em> for each possible vector of underlying parameters. Two points are worth highlighting however. The first is that rather than updating over the query directly (for instance <span class="math inline">\(\tau = .5\)</span>) directly, we update over the underlying parameter vector and map from underlying parameters to the query of interest. The second is that representing node values in vector forms like this allows for vector-level mappings that imply more complex dependencies between units. For instance we might imagine instead that we observe <span class="math inline">\(K=1\)</span> if and only if <span class="math inline">\(\theta = (b,b)\)</span>, in which case observation of <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> lets us distinguish between <span class="math inline">\(\tau = 1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\tau = .5\)</span> but not between <span class="math inline">\(\tau = .5\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\tau = 0\)</span>.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">9.2</span> General procedure</h2>
<p>While the basic conceptual operations are the same for multi case problems and single case problems, in practice, we generally do want to treat these problems differently. The reason is that if we can invoke independence assumptions across types then we can greatly reduce complexity by analyzing problems at the unit level rather than at the population level. In the example above <span class="math inline">\(\theta^Y\)</span> could take on any of 16 values; thought of at the unit level, <span class="math inline">\(\theta^Y\)</span> can take on only 4 values and we have two data points we can use to learn about the probability of each of these values. Thinking about it this way simplifies the problem, but it is not free. It requires invoking independence assumptions — that outcomes in two units do not depend on each other. If we cannot stand by that assumption, then we have to build independence failures into our models.</p>
<p>Taking this step the procedure we now use in the mixed methods works as follows.</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>A DAG</strong>. As for process tracing, we begin with a graphical causal model specifying possible causal linkages between nodes. Our “chain” model for instance has DAG: <span class="math inline">\(X \rightarrow M \rightarrow Y\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Nodal types</strong>. Just as in process tracing, the DAG and variable ranges define the set of possible nodal types in the model—the possible ways in which each variable is assigned (if exogenous) or determined by its parents (if endogenous). For the <span class="math inline">\(X \rightarrow M \rightarrow Y\)</span> model there are 2 types for <span class="math inline">\(\theta^X\)</span>, 4 for <span class="math inline">\(\theta^M\)</span>, and 4 for <span class="math inline">\(\theta^Y\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Causal types</strong>. A full set of nodal types gives rise to a full set of causal types, encompassing all possible combinations of nodal types across all nodes in the model. We let <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> denote an arbitrary causal type. For instance <span class="math inline">\(X \rightarrow M \rightarrow Y\)</span> we might have type <span class="math inline">\(\theta = (\theta^X_1, \theta^M_{01}, \theta^M_{01})\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Parameters.</strong> As before we use <span class="math inline">\(\lambda^V\)</span> to denote the probabilities of <span class="math inline">\(\theta^V\)</span>. Recall that in process tracing, we sought to learn about <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> and our priors were given by <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>. When we shift to multicase inference <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> becomes the parameter that we want to learn about: we seek to learn about the <em>shares</em> of different types in a population; knowledge about <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> may in turn give rise to beliefs about <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priors</strong>. In the process tracing case we treated <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> as given: we did not seek to learn about <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> and our uncertainty over <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> played no role. When we get to observe data on multiple cases, however, we have the opportunity to learn <em>both</em> about the cases at hand <em>and</em> about the population. Moreover, our level of uncertainty about population-level parameters will shape our inferences. We thus want our parameters (the <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>’s) to be drawn from a prior <em>distribution</em> — a distribution that expresses our uncertainty and over which we can update once we see the data. While different distributions may be appropriate to the task in general, uncertainty over proportions (of cases, events, etc.) falling into a set of discrete categories is usefully described by a Dirichlet distribution, as discussed in Chapter <a href="bayeschapter.html#bayeschapter">6</a>. The parameters of a Dirichlet distribution (the <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>’s) can be thought of as conveying both the relative expected proportions in each category and our degree of uncertainty.</p></li>

<p><strong>Box: Setting priors</strong></p>
<p>For a model with no unobserved confounding, setting priors requires specifying a prior distribution for each set of nodal types. Parameters are provided as vectors of positive numbers with one number for each nodal type. These numbers correspond to the <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> parameters of a Dirichlet distribution. The relative size of each number governs the the relative probability of each nodal type. The absolute sizes govern the certainty over the types.</p>
<p>For a simple <span class="math inline">\(X \rightarrow Y\)</span> model, we have two parameter sets: one for <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>’s types and one for <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>’s types.</p>
<p>For <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>’s types, we specify <span class="math inline">\(\alpha^X_0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\alpha^X_1\)</span>, corresponding to the nodal types <span class="math inline">\(\theta^X_0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\theta^X_1\)</span>, respectively. A distribution of the form (<span class="math inline">\(\alpha^X_0=100, \alpha^X_1=100)\)</span> implies a lot of confidence that a given unit has <span class="math inline">\(X=1\)</span> with probability .5. Or, equivalently, a lot of confidence that <span class="math inline">\(\lambda^X_1\)</span> is around .5. A distribution of the form (<span class="math inline">\(\alpha^X_0=.1, \alpha^X_1=.1)\)</span> implies that either <span class="math inline">\(X=1\)</span> with a high probability (for all units) or <span class="math inline">\(X=0\)</span> with a low probability (for all units), but we are not sure which.</p>
<p>For <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>’s types, we specify <span class="math inline">\(\alpha^Y_{00}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\alpha^Y_{10}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\alpha^Y_{01}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\alpha^Y_{11}\)</span>, corresponding to the nodal types <span class="math inline">\(\theta^Y_{00}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\theta^Y_{01}\)</span>, and so on. So, for instance:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\alpha^Y_{00}=1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\alpha^Y_{10}=1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\alpha^Y_{01}=1\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\alpha^Y_{11}=1\)</span> yields a uniform distribution in which all share allocations of types in the population are equally likely.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\alpha^Y_{00}=3\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\alpha^Y_{10}=3\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\alpha^Y_{01}=3\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\alpha^Y_{11}=3\)</span> puts more weight on share allocations in which the shares are relatively equal.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\alpha^Y_{00}=5\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\alpha^Y_{10}=5\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\alpha^Y_{01}=10\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\alpha^Y_{11}=5\)</span> puts greater weight positive causal effects than the other three types.</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice that we might want to express confidence in our beliefs about one node and a lot of uncertainty about another. But we are not able to express, for this model, confidence about <em>pairings</em> of nodes. That is, we cannot express the idea that we are confident that <span class="math inline">\(\theta^Y_{01}\)</span> is likely when <span class="math inline">\(\theta^X_1 = 1\)</span>. That kind of statement requires a model in which there is unobserved confounding between nodal types.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">9.2.2</span> Inference</h3>
<p>Inference then works like this:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Distributions over causal types.</strong> We first need to characterize our beliefs about causal types given any possible parameter vector <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>. Imagine a draw of one possible value of <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> from the prior. This <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> vector implies a probability distribution over each nodal type which in turn implies a distribution over <em>causal</em> types (<span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>). For instance, the probability of type <span class="math inline">\(\theta = (\theta^X_1, \theta^Y_{01}, \theta^M_{01})\)</span> is simply <span class="math inline">\(p(\theta|\lambda)=\lambda^X_1\lambda^M_{01}\lambda^Y_{01}\)</span>. More generally:</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="math display">\[p(\theta|\lambda) = \prod_{k,v:\theta^v_k\in\theta}\lambda^v_k\]</span></p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Event probabilities</strong>. Each causal type in turn implies a data type. For instance <span class="math inline">\(\theta = (\theta^X_1, \theta^M_{01}, \theta^Y_{01})\)</span> implies data <span class="math inline">\(X=1, M=1, Y=1\)</span>. Let <span class="math inline">\(D(\theta)\)</span> denote the data type implied by causal type <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>. We then use <span class="math inline">\(\Theta(d)\)</span> to denote the set of causal types that imply a given data type:</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="math display">\[\Theta(d) : \{\theta| D(\theta) = d \}\]</span></p>
<p>The probability of a data type <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>, is then simple:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[w_d = \sum_{\theta \in \Theta(d)}p(\theta|\lambda)\]</span></p>
<p>We use <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> to denote the vector of event probabilities over all data types.</p>
<p>To illustrate, an event <span class="math inline">\(d = (X=1, M =1, Y=1)\)</span> is consistent with four different causal types in the <span class="math inline">\(X\rightarrow M\rightarrow Y\)</span> model: <span class="math inline">\(\Theta(d) = \{(\theta^X_0, \theta^M_{01}, \theta^Y_{01}), (\theta^X_0, \theta^M_{11}, \theta^Y_{01}), (\theta^X_0, \theta^M_{01}, \theta^Y_{11}), (\theta^X_0, \theta^M_{11}, \theta^Y_{11})\}\)</span>. The probability of the event is then calculated by summing up the probabilities of each causal type that implies the event: <span class="math inline">\(w_{111}:=\lambda^X_1(\lambda^M_{01} + \lambda^M_{11}))(\lambda^Y_{01} + \lambda^Y_{11}))\)</span>.</p>
<p>In practice, calculating the full <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> vector is made easier by the construction of a “parameter matrix” and an “ambiguity matrix,” just as for process tracing, that tells us which causal types are consistent with a particular data type. Tables <a href="mixing.html#tab:parammmatrixmix">9.1</a> and <a href="mixing.html#tab:ambigmatrixmix">9.2</a> illustrate. We have indicated a single draw of <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> values (population type shares) in the parameter matrix, and these have been used to calculate the priors on causal types provided in the ambiguity matrix. Let’s now calculate the event probability for each data type. Starting with <span class="math inline">\(X=0, Y=0\)</span>, we can read off the ambiguity matrix that the consistent causal types are (<span class="math inline">\(\theta^X_0, \theta^Y_{00}\)</span>) and (<span class="math inline">\(\theta^X_0, \theta^Y_{01}\)</span>). The event probability, <span class="math inline">\(w_{00}\)</span>, is then given by adding together the probabilities of these two causal types, <span class="math inline">\(0.1 + 0.2 = 0.3\)</span>. All four event probabilities, for the four data types, are then calculated in the same way:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(w_{00} = 0.1 + 0.2 = 0.3\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(w_{10} = 0.1 + 0.1 = 0.2\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(w_{01} = 0.1 + 0.2 = 0.2\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(w_{11} = 0.2 + 0.1 = 0.3\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>As any case must be of one and only one data type, the full set of event probabilities for a single <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> draw must naturally sum to <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>.</p>

<li><strong>Likelihood</strong>. Now that we know the probability of observing each data pattern in a <em>single</em> case given <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>, we can use these event probabilities to aggregate up to the likelihood of observing a data pattern across multiple cases (given <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>). For this we make use of an independence assumption: that each unit is independently drawn from a common distribution. Doing so lets us move from a categorical distribution that gives the probability that a single case has a particular data type to a multinomial distribution that gives the probability of seeing a distribution of outcomes.</li>
</ol>
<p>With discrete variables, we can think of a given multiple-case data pattern simply as a set of counts: for, say, <span class="math inline">\(X, Y\)</span> data, we will observe a certain number of <span class="math inline">\(X=0, Y=0\)</span> cases (<span class="math inline">\(n_{00}\)</span>), a certain number of <span class="math inline">\(X=1, Y=0\)</span> cases (<span class="math inline">\(n_{10}\)</span>), a certain number of <span class="math inline">\(X=0, Y=1\)</span> cases (<span class="math inline">\(n_{01}\)</span>), and a certain number of <span class="math inline">\(X=1, Y=1\)</span> cases (<span class="math inline">\(n_{11}\)</span>). A data pattern, given a particular set of variables observed (a search strategy), thus has a multinomial distribution. The likelihood of a data pattern under a given search strategy, in turn, takes the form of a multinomial distribution conditional on the number of cases observed, <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, and the event probabilities for each data type, given a <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> draw. more formally we write:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[d \sim \text{Multinomial}(n, w(\lambda))\]</span></p>
<p>Let us assume now that we have a 3-node model, with <span class="math inline">\(X, Y\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> all binary. Let <span class="math inline">\(n_{XYK}\)</span> denote an 8-element vector recording the number of cases in a sample displaying each possible combination of <span class="math inline">\(X,Y,K\)</span> data, thus: <span class="math inline">\(d=n_{XYM}:=(n_{000},n_{001},n_{100},\dots ,n_{111})\)</span>. The elements of <span class="math inline">\(n_{XYK}\)</span> sum to <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, the total number of cases studied. Likewise, let the event probabilities for data types given <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> be registered in a vector, <span class="math inline">\(w_{XYK}=(w_{000},w_{001},w_{100},\dots ,w_{111})\)</span>. The likelihood of a data pattern, <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal D\)</span> is then:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
p(d|\lambda) = 
  \text{Multinom}\left(n_{XYK}|\sum n_{XYK}, w_{XYK}(\lambda)\right)  \\
\]</span>
In other words, the likelihood of observing a particular data pattern given <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> is given by the corresponding value of the multinomial distribution given the event probabilities.</p>

In the <code>CausalQueries</code> package this updating is implemented in <code>stan</code> and the result of the updating is a dataframe that contains collection of draws from the posterior distribution for <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>.

For instance the query “What is the average effect of <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>” is a question about the distribution of <span class="math inline">\(\lambda^M_{01} - \lambda^M_{10}\)</span>, which is given by the difference between columns 9 and 8 of the table. Still more complex queries may require keeping some nodes constant while varying others, yet all of these can be calculated as summaries of the combinations of columns of the posterior distribution, following the rules described in Chapter <a href="questions.html#questions">5</a>.</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">9.2.3.1</span> Unobserved confounding.</h4>
<p>When there is unobserved confounding, we need parameter sets that allow for a joint distribution over nodal types. Thus, if we believe the likelihood of <span class="math inline">\(X=1\)</span> is correlated with whether or not <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> has an effect on <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, we have to allow <span class="math inline">\(\theta^X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\theta^Y\)</span> to have a joint distribution. There are different ways to do this in practice but a simple approach is to specify one distribution for <span class="math inline">\(\theta^Y\)</span> when <span class="math inline">\(X=0\)</span> and another when <span class="math inline">\(X=1\)</span>. For each of these parameter sets, we specify two <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> parameters representing our priors. We can draw <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> values for these conditional nodal types from the resulting Dirichlet distributions, as above, and can then calculate causal type probabilities in the usual way. Note that if we do this in an <span class="math inline">\(X \rightarrow Y\)</span> model we have one 2 dimensional Dirichlet distribution and two 4 dimensional distributions in all, with 1+3+3 degrees of freedom: exactly the number needed to represent a joint distribution over all <span class="math inline">\(\theta^X, \theta^Y\)</span> combinations.</p>
<p>In the figure below we represent this confounding by indicating parameters values <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_{MY}\)</span> that determine the joint distribution over <span class="math inline">\(\theta_M\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\theta_Y\)</span>.</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">9.2.3.2</span> Partial data.</h4>
<p>For a case in which only partial data are observed, we follow the same basic logic as with partial process-tracing data. We retain all columns (data types) in the ambiguity matrix that are consistent with the partial data. So, for instance, if we observe only <span class="math inline">\(Y=1\)</span>, we would retain both the <span class="math inline">\(X=0, Y=1\)</span> column and the <span class="math inline">\(X=1, Y=1\)</span> column. We then calculate the event probability by summing causal-type probabilities for all causal types that could have produced these partial data — i.e., all those with a <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> in <em>either</em> column.</p>
<p>What if we have a mixture of search strategies? Suppose, for instance, that we have collected <span class="math inline">\(X,Y\)</span> data on a set of cases, and that we have additionally collected data on <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> for a random subset of these. We can think of this as conducting quantitative analysis on a large sample and conducting in-depth process tracing on a subsample. We then can summarize our data in two vectors, the 8-element <span class="math inline">\(n_{XYM}\)</span> vector for the cases with process tracing, and a 4-element vector <span class="math inline">\(n_{XY*} = (n_{00*},n_{10*},n_{01*},n_{11*}\)</span> for the partial data on those cases with no process tracing. Likewise, we now have two sets of event probabilities: one for the cases with complete data, <span class="math inline">\(w_{XYM}\)</span>, and a 4-element vector for those with partial data, <span class="math inline">\(w_{XY*}\)</span>. Let <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> denote the total number of cases examined, and <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> the number for which we have data on <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now, assuming that each observed case represents an independent, random draw from the population, we can form the likelihood function as a product of multinomial distributions:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\Pr(\mathcal{D}|\theta) = 
  \text{Multinom}\left(n_{XY*}|n-k, w_{XY*}\right) \times \text{Multinom}\left(n_{XYK}|k, w_{XYK}\right)  \\

<!-- ## Illustration  -->
<!-- Consider a generalization of the models introduced in Chapter 6 in which a treatment $X$ is a cause of both $K$ and $Y$, and outcome $Y$ is a product of both $X$ and $K$. Though $K$ is both a mediator and a moderator for the effect of $X$. There are now 16 nodal types for $Y$, 4 for $K$ and 2 for $X$, yielding 32 causal types. -->
<!-- To allow for the possibility of non-random selection of $X$ we will assume that the assignment probability for $X$ depends on $U^Y$. This is a feature shared also in the baseline model when we specify $\pi$ as a function of types $a$,$b$,$c$,$d$. -->
<!-- Our piors requires specifying: -->
<!-- 1. A distribution over the 15-dimensional simplex representing possible values of $\lambda^Y$--which in turn determine types $u^Y$. -->
<!-- 2. A distribution over the 3-dimensional vector representing possible values of $\lambda^K$,  which in turn determine types $u^K$. -->
<!-- The model is restricted in various ways. We assume now confounding in the assignemnt of $X$. Less obviously we implicitly assume that $K$ is independent of $\theta^Y$ conditional on $X$. -->
<!-- With these elements in hand, however, all we need now is to provide a mapping from these fundamental parameters to the parameters used in the baseline model to form the likelihood.  -->
<!-- The key transformation is the identification of causal types resulting from the 64 combinations of $\lambda^Y$ and $\lambda^K$. These are shown below. -->
<!-- TABLE TO SHOW CAUSAL TYPES -->
<!-- Consider the following matrices of values for $u_Y$ and $u_K$, where $\lambda_{pq}^{rs}$ is the probability that $u^Y = t_{pq}^{rs}$, meaning that $Y$ would take the value $p$ when $X=0, K=0$,  $q$ when $X=0, K=1$,  $r$ when $X=1, K=0$,  and $s$ when $X=1, K=1$. Similarly $\lambda_{w}^{z}$ is the probability that $u^K$ takes value  $t_{w}^{z}$  meaning that $K$ takes the value $w$ when $X=0$ and $z$ when $X=1$. -->
<!-- TABLE TO SHOW CONDITIONAL PROBABILITIES OF K GIVEN X=1 AND TYPE -->
<!-- These types are the *transformed parameters*; the probability of a type is just the sum of the probabilities of the fundamental types that compose it, formed by taking the product of the $\lambda^Y$ and $\lambda^K$ values marked in the rows and columns of  table \ref{tab:types}.  -->
<!-- Similarly $\phi_{tx}$ can be constructed as the probability of observing $K$ conditional on this type (again, sums of products of probabilities associated with cells in table  \ref{tab:types}).

<h3><span class="header-section-number">9.3.1</span> Probative value can be derived from a causal structure plus data</h3>
<p>In Chapter <a href="pt.html#pt">7</a>, we discussed the fact that a DAG by itself is insufficient to generate learning about causal effects from data on a single case; we also need informative prior beliefs about population-level shares of nodal types.</p>
<p>When working with multiple cases, however, we <em>can</em> learn about causal relations when starting with nothing more than the DAG and data. In particular we can simultaneously learn about case level queries and justify our inferences from population level data patterns.</p>
<p>For instance, in an <span class="math inline">\(X \rightarrow M \rightarrow Y\)</span> model, even if we start with flat priors over <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>’s nodal types, observing a correlation (or no correlation) between <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> across multiple cases provides information about <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>’s effect on <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>. Simply, a stronger, positive (negative) <span class="math inline">\(X, M\)</span> correlation implies a stronger positive (negative) effect of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>. In turn, a stronger <span class="math inline">\(X,M\)</span> correlation implies a stronger effect of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> since, under this model, that effect has to run through an effect of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>.</p>
<p>What’s more, data from multiple cases can <em>provide</em> probative value for within-case inference. Suppose, for the <span class="math inline">\(X \rightarrow M \rightarrow Y\)</span> model, that we start with flat priors over all nodal types. As discussed in Chapter <a href="pt.html#pt">7</a>, observing <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> in a single case cannot be informative about <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>’s effect on <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> in that case. If we have no idea of the direction of the intermediate causal effects, then we have no idea which value of <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is more consistent with an <span class="math inline">\(X \rightarrow M\)</span> effect or which an <span class="math inline">\(M \rightarrow Y\)</span> effect. But suppose that we first observe data on <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> for a group of cases and find a strong positive correlation between the two variables. We now update to a belief that any effect of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is more likely to be positive than negative. Now, let’s say we look at one of our cases, in which <span class="math inline">\(X=1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y=1\)</span> and want to know if <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> caused <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>. Knowing now that any such effect would most likely have operated via a positive <span class="math inline">\(X \rightarrow M\)</span> effect means that observing <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> will be informative: <span class="math inline">\(M=1\)</span> will be more consistent with an <span class="math inline">\(X \rightarrow Y\)</span> effect than will <span class="math inline">\(M=0\)</span>. The same logic, of course, also holds for observing cross-case correlations between <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>.</p>
<p>Drawing probative value from cross-case data is, of course, dependent on the causal model. For instance, if <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> also has a direct effect on <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, this would limit our ability to learn from <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>. We explore this case in much greater detail in chapter REF: CASE SELECTION.</p>

<div id="learning-without-identification" class="section level3" number="9.3.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">9.3.2</span> Learning without identification</h3>
<p>Some causal queries are “identified” while others are not. When a query is identified, each true value for the query is associated with a unique data distribution given infinite data. As we gather more and more data, our posterior on the query should converge on the true value. When a query is not identified, multiple true values of the query will be associated with the same data distribution given infinite data. With a non-identified query, our posterior will never converge on a unique value regardless of how much data we collect; multiple answers will be equally consistent with the data.</p>
<p>We can illustrate the difference by comparing an <span class="math inline">\(ATE\)</span> query to a probability of causation query for a simple <span class="math inline">\(X \rightarrow Y\)</span> model. When asking about the <span class="math inline">\(ATE\)</span>, we are asking about the average effect of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, or the difference between <span class="math inline">\(\lambda^Y_{01}\)</span> (share of units with positive effects) and <span class="math inline">\(\lambda^Y_{10}\)</span> (share with negative effects). When asking about the probability of causation, we are asking, for a case with given values of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, about the probability that <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> caused <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> in that case. This query is defined by a different set of parameters. For, say, an <span class="math inline">\(X=1, Y=1\)</span> case and our <span class="math inline">\(X \rightarrow Y\)</span> model, the probability of causation is given by just <span class="math inline">\(\lambda^Y_{01}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Let us assume a “true” set of parameters, unknown to the researcher, such that <span class="math inline">\(\lambda^Y_{01} = 0.6\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\lambda^Y_{10} = 0.1\)</span> while we set <span class="math inline">\(\lambda^Y_{00} = 0.2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\lambda^Y_{11} = 0.1\)</span>. Thus, the true average causal effect is <span class="math inline">\(0.5\)</span>. We now use the parameters and the model to simulate a large amount of data (<span class="math inline">\(N=10,000\)</span>). We then return to the model, set flat priors over nodal types, and update the model using the simulated data. We graph the posterior on our two queries, the <span class="math inline">\(ATE\)</span> and the probability of positive causation in an <span class="math inline">\(X=1, Y=1\)</span> case, in Figure <a href="#PChist"><strong>??</strong></a>.</p>
<div class="figure"><span id="fig:PChist"></span>

<p class="caption">
Figure 9.3: ATE is identified, PC is not identified but has informative bounds
</p>
</div>
<p>The figure illustrates nicely the difference between an identified and non-identified query. While the <span class="math inline">\(ATE\)</span> converges on the right answer, the probability of causation fails to converge even with a massive amount of data. We see instead a range of values for this query on which our updated model places roughly equal posterior probability.</p>
<p>Importantly, however, we see that we <em>do</em> learn about the probability of causation. Despite the lack of convergence, our posterior rules out a wide range of values. While our prior on the query was 0.5, we have correctly updated toward a range of values that includes (and happens to be fairly well centered over) the true value (<span class="math inline">\(\approx 0.86\)</span>).</p>
<p>A distinctive feature of updating a causal model is that it allows us to learn about non-identified quantities in this manner. We will end up with “ridges” in our posterior distributions: ranges or combinations of parameter values that are equally likely given the data. But our posterior weight can nonetheless shift toward the right answer.</p>
<p>At the same time, for non-identified queries, we have to be cautious about the impact of our priors. As <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> becomes large, the remaining curvature we see in our posteriors may simply be function of those priors. One way to inspect for this is to simulate a very large dataset and see whether the curvature remainsXXXXXXXXXX A second approach would be to do sensitivity analyses by updating the model on the same data with different sets of priors to see how this affects the shape of the posterior.</p>
<!-- Identified quantity is that each true theta, with infinite data, has a unique data distribution associated with it. If not identified, multiple different thetas will have different infinite-data distributions associated with them. E.g., COE. If it's the same, you won't know which it is. This is why we'll get ridges in the posteriors. So as you scale up data, you might rule out other things, but those theta's will always scale up together. So you'll never discriminate between those, but you'll learn about those things relative other things. -->
<!-- Use Fig. 6.1 from Causal Models guide. -->
<!-- So that's still learning. We can learn about unidentified quantities.   -->
<!-- But the bad news is that, for a not-identified quantity, your priors will matter: the curvature that gives us a maximum in our posterior will be driven by the posteriors. To distinguish between what part of the posterior is from the data and what's from the data would be to simulate infinite data and see what happens to the  -->

<h3><span class="header-section-number">9.3.3</span> Beyond binary data</h3>
<p>While the setup used in this book involves only binary nodes, the approach readily generalizes readily to non binary data.</p>
<p>To do so we need to be able to expand the nodal space to accommodate the richer range of possible relations between nodes. Suppose that we want to operate with variables with 4 ordinal categories. In an <span class="math inline">\(X \rightarrow Y\)</span> model, <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>’s nodal types have to accommodate 4 possible values that <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> can take on, and 4 possible values that <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> can take on for any value of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. This yields <span class="math inline">\(4^4 = 256\)</span> nodal types for <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> and 1024 causal types (compared to just 8 in the binary case). Moving beyond binary nodes allows for considerably greater flexibility in response functions. For instance, non monotonic relations can be described with with just three values on <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>. More complex queries might include: “What is the probability that <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is linear in <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>?” or “What is the probability that <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is concave in <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>?” or “What is the probability that <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is monotonic in <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>?”</p>
<p>The <code>CausalQueries</code> package, set up to work with binary nodes, can be used for non binary data also. The trick is to express integers in base 2 and represent the integer as a series of 0s and 1s on multiple nodes. For instance if <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> each have four values we might code the values of both <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> in base 2 as elements of <span class="math inline">\(00, 01, 10, 11\)</span> and capture all possible values on a model with <span class="math inline">\(Y_1 \leftarrow X_1 \rightarrow Y_2, Y_1 \leftarrow X_2 \rightarrow Y_2\)</span>. Thus the information on <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> gets fully recorded on 4 nodes rather than 2: non binary data <span class="math inline">\(X=3, Y=2\)</span> gets represented with binary data <span class="math inline">\(X_1=1, X_2=1, Y_1=1, Y_2 = 0\)</span>. Note that both <span class="math inline">\(X_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(X_2\)</span> point into each of <span class="math inline">\(Y_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y_2\)</span>, resulting in <span class="math inline">\(2\times 2\times 16 \times 16 = 1024\)</span> causal types, as required. To allow for the full range of nodal types we need to allow a joint distribution over <span class="math inline">\(\theta^X_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\theta^X_2\)</span> and over <span class="math inline">\(\theta^Y_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\theta^Y_2\)</span> which results in 3 degrees of freedom for <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and 255 for <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, as required.</p>
<p>In the illustration below we imagine a model in which <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> each take on 4 possible values. We generate data from a non-monotonic process in which <span class="math inline">\(Y(0)=0, Y(1)=1, Y(2)=3, Y(3) = 2\)</span>. We then update and report on posteriors on potential outcomes.</p>
<p>We make use of a couple of helper functions to simplify working with conversions from statements on integers to statements on the binary representation of the integers.</p>

<p>We see that we do well. As in the binary case, the posterior reflects both the data and the priors. As in the binary case also we have access to a full posterior distribution over all nodal types and can thus ask arbitrary queries of the updated model.</p>
<p>The greatest challenge expanding to non binary data is computation. If <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> takes on <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> possible values and has <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> parents, each taking on <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> possible values, we then have <span class="math inline">\(m^{r^k}\)</span> nodal types for <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>. Thus, the cost of more granular measurement is complexity – an explosion of the parameter space – as the nodal type space expands rapidly with the granularity of measurement and the number of explanatory variables With 3 3-level ordinal variables pointing into the same outcome, we have <span class="math inline">\(3^{27} = 7.6\)</span> <em>trillion</em> nodal types!</p>
<p>We expect that, as measurement becomes more granular, researchers will want to manage the complexity by placing structure onto the possible patterns of causal effects. Structure, imposed through model restrictions, can quite rapidly tame the complexity. For some substantive problems, one form of structure we might be willing to impose is monotonicity. In a <span class="math inline">\(X \rightarrow Y\)</span> model with 3-level variables, excluding non-monotonic effects brings down the number of nodal types from 27 to 17. Alternatively, we may have a strong reason to rule out effects in one direction: disallowing negative effects, for instance, brings us down to 10 nodal types. If we are willing to assume linearity the number of nodal types falls further to 5.</p>
<!-- REMOVE REFERENCE TO OLS; SAY WE DEAL WITH THIS ELSEWHERE IN THE CONCLUSION. -->
<!-- Of course, standard approaches to empirical modeling typically impose a great deal of structure -- consider, for instance, the ubiquity of the linearity assumption in regression modeling -- for precisely the same reason: to simplify the parameter space. As with other forms of empirical modeling, researchers working with causal models will need to decide how they want to trade off model fit and complexity of the parameter space in the choices they make about nodal measurement and model restrictions.  -->
<!-- We can still think in terms of types -->
<!-- With 3 levels of X and 3 levels of Y, you have 27 possible types. But if you impose linearity, only 5 types. If it's non-negative, there will be a few more. -->
<!-- Warning: gets very complicated -->
<!-- Possible strategy is to impose structure, which other approaches also do.  -->
<!-- Asymptotically approaches linearity -->

<h3><span class="header-section-number">9.3.4</span> Measurement error</h3>
<p>One potential application of the approach we have described in this chapter to integrating differing forms of data is to addressing the problem of measurement error. The conceptual move to address measurement error in a causal model setup is quite simple: we incorporate the error-generating process into our model.</p>
<p>Consider, for instance, a model in which we build in a process generating measurement error on the dependent variable.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[X \rightarrow Y  \rightarrow Y_\text{measured} \leftarrow \text{source of measurement error}\]</span></p>
<p>Here <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> has an effect on the true value of our outcome of interest, <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>. The true value of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, in turn, has an effect on the value of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> that we measure, but so too does a potential problem with our coding process. Thus, the measured value of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is a function of both the true value and error.</p>
<p>To motivate the setup, imagine that we are interested in the effect of a rule restricting long-term care staff to working at a single site (<span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>) on novel coronavirus outbreaks in long-term care facilities (<span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>), defined as infections among two or more staff or residents. We do not directly observe infections, however; rather, we observe positive results of PCR tests. We also know that testing is neither comprehensive nor uniform. For some units, regular random testing is carried out on staff and residents while in others only symptomatic individuals are tested. It is the latter arrangement that potentially introduces measurement error.</p>
<p>If we approach the problem naively, ignoring measurement error and treating <span class="math inline">\(Y_\text{measured}\)</span> as though it were identical to <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, we would face attenuation bias in our estimates of the effect of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> if some units are engaged in only symptomatic testing and this generates missed outbreaks. A slightly more sophisticated approach would be to acknowledge this attenuation bias, treating our estimate of the <span class="math inline">\(ATE\)</span> as a lower bound.</p>
<p>Yet we can go further if we work with the above causal model. Without any additional data, we can update on both <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_Y\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\lambda^{Y_\text{measured}}\)</span>. We could, for instance, impose restrictions that exclude negative effects of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(Y_\text{measured}\)</span>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Then, if we observe (say) a negative correlation between <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y_\text{measured}\)</span>, we can update on the substantive effect of interest – <span class="math inline">\(\lambda^Y\)</span> – in the direction of a larger share of negative effects: it is only <em>via</em> negative effects of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> that a negative correlation between <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y_\text{measured}\)</span> could emerge. At the same time, we learn about the measure as we update on <span class="math inline">\(\lambda^{Y_\text{measured}}\)</span>: the negative observed correlation <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y_\text{measured}\)</span> is an indicator of the degree to which <span class="math inline">\(Y_\text{measured}\)</span> is picking up true <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>.</p>
<p>We can do considerably better, however, if we can collect more detailed information on at least some units. One data strategy would be to invest in observing, <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, the true outbreak status of each unit for a subset of units on which we already have data on <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y_\text{measured}\)</span> — say, by implementing our own random-testing protocol at a set of facilities. Observing both <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and the true <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> will allow us to update more directly on <span class="math inline">\(\lambda^Y\)</span>, the true effect of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>. Just as importantly, observing both <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y_\text{measured}\)</span> will allow us to update more directly on measurement quality, <span class="math inline">\(\lambda^{Y_\text{measured}}\)</span>.</p>
<p>A second data strategy (which could be combined with the first) would be to collect data, for some subset of units, on the source of the measurement error. If we collected data on the use of random vs. symptomatic-only testing, we could then update on two further parameters: <span class="math inline">\(\lambda^\text{source of measurement error}\)</span> and on the part of <span class="math inline">\(\lambda^{Y_\text{measured}}\)</span> representing response of <span class="math inline">\(Y_\text{measured}\)</span>. In other words, we would learn both about how prevalent the conditions generating measurement error are and about much they throw off our measure.</p>
<!-- * What if we are naive: attenuation bias with binary -->
<!-- * What if we are aware of risks but don't know how bad bad coding is -->
<!-- * What if we observed bad coding in a subsample -->
<!-- We have assumed no measurement error; in applications there could be considerable interest in measurement error. On one hand clue information may contain information about possible mismeasurement on $X$ and $Y$; on the other hand there might interest in whether measured clues adequately capture those features of a causal process that is thought to be measureable.   -->
<!-- The probability of different types of measurement error can be included among the set of parameters of interest, with likelihood functions adjusted accordingly. Suppose, for instance, that with probability $\epsilon$ a $Y=0$ case is recorded as a $Y=1$ case (and vice versa). Then the event probability of observing an $X=1$,$Y=1$ case, for example, is $\epsilon \lambda_a \pi_a + (1-\epsilon) \lambda_b \pi_b + \epsilon \lambda_c \pi_c + (1-\epsilon) \lambda_d \pi_d$. %If instead there were measurement error on $X$ but not on $Y$, then the event probability would be: $\epsilon \lambda_a (1-\pi_a) + (1-\epsilon) \lambda_b \pi_b + \epsilon \lambda_d (1-\pi_d) + (1-\epsilon) \lambda_d \pi_d$.  -->
<!-- Similar expressions can be derived for measurement error on $X$ or $K$. Specifying the problem in this way allows us both to take account of measurement error and learn about it. -->

<div id="spillovers" class="section level3" number="9.3.5">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">9.3.5</span> Spillovers</h3>
<p>A common threat to causal inference is the possibility of spillovers: a given unit’s outcome being affected by the treatment status of another (e.g., possibly neighboring) unit. We can readily set up a causal model to allow for estimation of various quantities related to spillovers.</p>
<p>Consider, for instance, the causal model represented in Figure <a href="#spillover"><strong>??</strong></a>. We consider here a cluster of 3 units across which spillovers might occur. We might imagine, for instance, a cluster of geographically proximate villages separated from other clusters such that spillovers might occur between villages within a cluster, but can be ruled out across clusters. Here <span class="math inline">\(X_i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y_i\)</span> represent village <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>’s treatment status and outcome, respectively. The pattern of directed edges indicates that each village’s outcome might be affected both by its own and by its neighbors’ treatment status.</p>
<p>We now simulate data that allow for spillovers. Specifically, while independently assigning <span class="math inline">\(X_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(X_2\)</span> to treatment <span class="math inline">\(50 \%\)</span> of the time, we (a) set <span class="math inline">\(Y_1\)</span> equal to <span class="math inline">\(X_1\)</span>, meaning that Unit 1 is affected only by its own treatment status and (b) set <span class="math inline">\(Y_2\)</span> equal to <span class="math inline">\(X_1 \times X_2\)</span>, meaning that Unit 2 is equally affected by its own treatment status and that of its neighbor, such that <span class="math inline">\(Y_2 = 1\)</span> only if both Unit 2 and its neighbor are assigned to treatment.</p>
<p>We simulate 100 observations from this data-generating process and then update a model (with flat priors over all nodal types).</p>
<p>Now we can extract a number of spillover-relevant causal quantities from the updated model. First we ask: what is the average effect of exposing a unit <em>directly</em> to treatment (“only_self_treated”) when the neighboring unit is untreated? Under the data-generating process that we have posited, we know that this effect will be <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> for Unit 1 (which always has a positive treatment effect) and <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> for Unit 2 (which sees a positive effect of <span class="math inline">\(X_2\)</span> only when <span class="math inline">\(X_1 = 1\)</span>), yielding an average across the two units of <span class="math inline">\(0.5\)</span>. We see from Table XXXX that we update, given our 100 observations, from a prior of 0 to a posterior mean of 0.371, approaching the right answer.</p>
<p>A second question we can ask is about the spillover by itself: what is the average treatment effect for a unit of its neighbor being assigned to treatment when the unit itself is not assigned to treatment (“only_other_treated”)? We know that the correct answer is <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> since Unit 1 responds only to its own treatment status, and Unit 2 requires that both units be assigned to treatment to see an effect. Our posterior estimate of this effect is right on target, at 0.</p>
<p>We can then ask about the average effect of <em>any</em> one unit being treated, as compared to no units being treated (“one_treated”). This is more complex quantity. We have to think about what happens to Unit 1 when only <span class="math inline">\(X_1\)</span> shifts from control to treatment (with <span class="math inline">\(X_2\)</span> at control) (true effect is <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>$); what happens to Unit 1 when only <span class="math inline">\(X_2\)</span> shifts from control to treatment (with <span class="math inline">\(X_1\)</span> at control) (true effect is <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>); and the same two effects for Unit 2 (both true effects are <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> – and then average across both the treatment conditions and units. We get <span class="math inline">\(0.186\)</span>, not far from the true value of <span class="math inline">\(0.25\)</span>.</p>
<p>Finally, we can ask about the average effect of both treatments going from control to treatment (“both_treated”). The true value of this effect is <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> for both units, and the posterior has shifted quite far in the direction of this value.</p>
<p>Obviously, more complex setups are possible. Also, we can model the process in a way that allows for more learning across units. In the present model, learning about effects for Unit 1 in a cluster tells us nothing about effects for Unit 2 in a cluster as they have completely independent nodal types. We could instead want to treat all units as drawn from the same population with, for instance, a graph with just one <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> and two treatment nodes, one for the unit’s own treatment status and one for its neighbor’s treatment status.</p>
<!-- The dataset will now be structured such that the "unit" of analysis is the *cluster*. WAIT, I AM NOT SURE THIS IS RIGHT. CAN'T WE HAVE THE UNITS BE VILLAGES, WITH THE COLUMNS IN THE DATASET BEING X1, X2, X3, Y_i FOR ALL VILLAGES? -->

<!-- Spillovers may also be addressed through an appropriate definition of causal types. For example a unit $i$ that is affected either by receiving treatment or via the treatment of a neighbor, $j$, might have potential outcomes $Y_i(X_i,X_j)=\max(X_i,X_j)$ while another type that is not influenced by neighbor treatment status has  $Y_i(X_i,X_j)=\max(X_i)$. With such a set-up, relevant clue information might discriminate between units affected by spillovers and those unaffected.    -->

<h3><span class="header-section-number">9.3.6</span> Clustering</h3>
<p>We can also represent some forms of clustering, understood as the presence of an exogenous but unobserved factor that influences outcomes for some subgroup of units. For instance, we might be interested in effects of training on individuals’ employment prospects, while recognizing that individuals living in the same neighborhood will be affected by common neighborhood-level features that we cannot directly observe.</p>
<p>We can capture some forms of clustering by placing the cluster-level factor on the graph.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Let us imagine that we are studying the effect of providing public health insurance coverage on health outcomes for individuals in two-adult households that have a single earner. Our units of analysis are individuals, but these units are clustered into pairs within households.</p>

We restrict the model such that, more specifically, <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> shuts off effects of health insurance for both individuals. By representing earners and non-earners separately on the graph, we allow for different effects of health insurance for these two different kinds of individuals. By representing the cluster-level factor, <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span>, on the graph, we also allow for <em>learning</em> across types of units: seeing effects (or non-effects) for one kind of unit allows us to update on <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span>’s value, which in turn provides information about effects for the other type of unit.</p>
<p>One question we can ask with this setup is: would we learn more from concentrating our observations within a smaller number of clusters or spreading them out across clusters? In Table XXXX, we show results from two different data-collection strategies. In one instance, we observe both Unit 1 and Unit 2 and in two clusters. In the other instance, we observe only Unit 1 in two clusters and only Unit 2 in two clusters. Both sets of data are drawn from a process in which the true treatment effect is XXXXXX. In both situations, we calculate the same estimand, the average treatment effect, defined as the effect of providing health insurance, averaged across the two unit types. and define estimands as average effects for both units in a pair. WHY DO WE THINK THE SECOND STRATEGY IS BETTER? SEEM VERY SIMILAR.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">9.3.8</span> Prior data/beliefs “channel” the learning from new data</h3>
<p>When we learn from new data, we always update <em>conditional</em> on any prior information. Consider the following example. Suppose that we are working with our familiar <span class="math inline">\(X \rightarrow M \rightarrow Y\)</span> model. We first observe a large amount of <span class="math inline">\(X,Y\)</span> data in which the two variables are strongly and positively correlated, thus indicative of a positive <span class="math inline">\(ATE\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>. Next, we turn to process tracing a small number of cases: suppose we collect data on <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> in one <span class="math inline">\(X=1, Y=1\)</span> case and one <span class="math inline">\(X=0, Y=0\)</span> case, and we observe <span class="math inline">\(M=1\)</span> in both cases. Well, <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is uncorrelated with <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> across these two cases, constituting evidence against an effect of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>. Since these are both cases in which a positive effect <em>could</em> have been operating, this finding will reduce our posterior on the share of positive effects in the population and, in turn, on the <span class="math inline">\(ATE\)</span>.</p>
<p>However, the strong prior information on the <span class="math inline">\(ATE\)</span> that we began with still anchors our updating. Our downward updating on the <span class="math inline">\(ATE\)</span> will be modest since our posterior is always a compromise between our (here, strong) priors and new information. More precisely, we will update less on the <span class="math inline">\(ATE\)</span>, about which we had strong prior information, than we will update about the share of positive effects, about which our prior data provided weaker information.</p>
<p>In addition, there is a knock-on effect for our beliefs about the share of negative effects in the population. If we have a strong prior about the value of the <span class="math inline">\(ATE\)</span>, and our beliefs about the share of positive effects goes down substantially, then our beliefs about the share of negative effects must <em>also</em> fall. (Recall that the <span class="math inline">\(ATE\)</span> is simply the share of positive effects minus the share of negative effects.) Intuitively, we can think of our beliefs about negative effects as updating to “preserve” our beliefs about the <span class="math inline">\(ATE\)</span>. And note that, if we had had <em>no</em> prior information about average effects, then learning about positive effects would have have had no implications for our beliefs about negative effects since there would be no overall constraint on the relationship between positive- and negative effect shares.</p>
<p>A more general way to describe this dynamic is that learning about a kind of case that we directly observe can generate “second-hand” learning about a kind of case that we do not directly observe <em>through</em> the constraint on our beliefs imposed by the our priors. This is, really, just a special instance of our priors generating probative value: our prior on the <span class="math inline">\(ATE\)</span> can make evidence about positive effects informative about negative effects. If we had flat priors on the <span class="math inline">\(ATE\)</span>, learning about positive effects would have no impact on our beliefs about negative effects.</p>
<p>A parallel example arises when we want to learn about a model with multiple causal pathways. Consider the model <span class="math inline">\(X \rightarrow M \rightarrow Y \leftarrow N \leftarrow X\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> can have an effect on <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> through either <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>. And let us set priors such that we believe the the two paths to be equally likely. Suppose that, as before, we have started with a substantial amount of <span class="math inline">\(X,Y\)</span> data indicative of a large positive <span class="math inline">\(ATE\)</span>. Now, we look for data on <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> in a handful of cases and find an <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> pattern inconsistent with any kind of effect through <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>. What happens to our beliefs about the <span class="math inline">\(ATE\)</span>? In general, finding evidence against one way an effect can happen should reduce our confidence in the effect happening at all. However, if we have started out with a strong prior on the <span class="math inline">\(ATE\)</span> but equal prior weight on the <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> pathways, then what we will see is countervailing updating across the two pathways: while our confidence in the operation of the <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> pathway will fall substantially, our posterior on effects operating via the <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> pathway will <em>rise</em> — because of the constraint on the total effect imposed by our strong priors on the <span class="math inline">\(ATE\)</span>. And our <span class="math inline">\(ATE\)</span> beliefs will fall only modestly. Evidence against the <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>-pathway effect will function as evidence for the <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>-pathway effects and, to a limited degree, as evidence against a total effect.</p>
<p>A further implication for process tracing is that there will generally be sharp limits to what we can learn about total effects if we study mediators along only <em>some</em> of the theorized pathways if we already have some prior information about total effects. The difficulty is that whatever we learn from the mediators we <em>do</em> observe will be offset by countervailing shifts in our beliefs about other pathways, generated by the constraint in our prior knowledge about the total effect. Suppose, for instance, that we start with some belief that economic development makes democracy more likely, and we believe that there may be two mechanisms: one operating through a rising middle class and one operating through a more robust and organized working class. Suppose then that we examine data on the organization of the working class and find that it does not vary with per capita GDP. We will then, of course, reduce our confidence in the working-class pathway. However, we must also <em>increase</em> our confidence in the operation of the middle-class pathway — because (a) we have prior reason to believe that the overall development <span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow\)</span> democracy effect exists and (b) we have not observed a mediator along the middle-class pathway. On balance, then, learning about just the one pathway will not have a large impact on beliefs about the overall effect of GDP on democratization. The larger lesson here is that, if our process tracing strategy involves the examination of mediators to learn about total <span class="math inline">\(X \rightarrow Y\)</span> effects, then how much we stand to learn depends on how comprehensively our examination of mediators covers the plausible pathways connecting <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>.</p>
<p>To be clear, we do not need to collect mediator clues on all <em>possible</em> pathways. If we have strong priors that one or more possible pathways are very unlikely, then we might safely be able to avoid collecting observations along those pathways without substantially reducing the prospects for learning.</p>
<p>Also, the specific point that we are making here applies to using mediator data to answer queries about the effect of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>. If instead we want to know which <em>particular pathway</em> is operating, then the lesson here is quite different, and more encouraging. For one thing, collecting evidence on just one pathway can be highly informative about the operation of that pathway. For another, if we do have strong priors on the <span class="math inline">\(ATE\)</span>, then learning about one pathway can <em>also</em> be informative about other pathways, just as we saw in our <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>- and <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>-pathway example.</p>
<!-- ## Principles of reasoning about learning -->
<!-- As we did in Chapter \@ref(pt), we provide here some guidance in how to reason about the learning that arises from mixed data. We focus especially on ways in which learning from multiple cases differs from learning from a single case. -->
<!-- AJ: We'd discussed this going here, but I think it would be better placed in a substantive chapter. This is where people will be more likely to look for it.  -->
<!-- 1. Learning requires uncertainty. And expected learning goes up as you become more uncertain about what you’ll find.  If your causal model puts a very high probability on X having a positive effect on M, and you already know X’s value, you should expect to learn very little from observing M since you’re very likely to see exactly the M value you expect given X. (Currently in Chap. 12)((And we want to make research design choices based on expected learning, not based on the mere possibility of learning: yes, our beliefs will shift if we look for M and find the unexpected value. But because that data-realization is highly unlikely, we expect the learning from observing M to be minimal.  -->
<!-- 2. Pure within-case (or n=1) learning requires informative priors about the nodes to be observed. For instance, in a chain model, where we want to go and observe M, it’s not enough to have an informative prior about the X->Y relationship. We need an informative prior about the X->M or M->Y link in order to learn from M. For instance, are positive X->M effects more common than negative ones? -->
<!-- 4. If there are different ways a query can be satisfied, evidence against one of those ways is evidence against the query as a whole. Say we have a two-path model — with one direct and one indirect path — and we want to know if X affects Y. We observe a mediator, M, along the indirect path in a set of cases. If the M data pattern is inconsistent with an indirect effect, then this is also evidence against an overall effect. In general, finding evidence against one way the effect can happen reduces our confidence in the effect happening at all.  -->
<!-- Moreover, the degree to which prior data constrains learning depends, of course, on how much prior data we have. In the $X \rightarrow M \rightarrow Y$ model, if we have observed only a small amount of prior $X,Y$ data, then observing $M$ in a handful of cases will lead us to update more strongly on the $ATE$ in the above examples, then observing the M data in the on-the-regression-line cases will have a weaker impact on our beliefs about negative effects, and a bigger impact on our beliefs about ATE. Ditto for the 2-path model example. However, where prior data/beliefs on the ATE are strong, we’ll learn less about the ATE, and more about negative effects (or the direct path).  -->
<!-- 7. If there are different ways in which a query can be satisfied, evidence against the likelier way is stronger evidence against the query than is evidence against an unlikelier way. In the 2-path model, if we started out thinking that the indirect effect was more likely than the direct effect, then evidence against the direct effect will have a bigger impact on our beliefs about the overall model.  -->
<!-- 8. It is difficult to get empirical leverage on very unlikely queries. And queries may be unlikelier than they appear. Suppose we start with the 2-path model, and want to know if X has a positive effect on Y that rests on a chain of positive effects via M. And suppose, importantly, that we begin with flat priors over all nodal types. Our intuitions likely tell us that this is exactly the kind of question for which an observation of M is the perfect empirical strategy. And that intuition is, in a sense, correct: we can indeed learn about the query by observing M. Seeing M=1 in an X=Y=1 case, for instance. would be evidence consistent with the query while M=0 would be inconsistent. Fine. ((But we will only learn a little from this observation. The reason is that the query itself has a very low prior probability. It may actually not be obvious at first glance just how unlikely our query is to be true. (After all, the model has two causal paths, and we’re asking if positive effects run through one of them, right? Not quite.) Seeing this requires us to think about the joint probabilities implied by the query. First, the query requires X to have a positive effect on M, which we think there’s only a 25% chance of. In addition, the query puts a very narrow constraint on Y’s possible nodal types:  Y has to have a nodal type in which M has a positive effect on Y when X does not change, and in which X does not have a positive effect on Y unless M changes from 0 to 1. This pair of conditions is met by only 2 of Y’s 16 nodal types, implying a 12.5% chance. The prior on the query is thus 0.25 x 0.125 = 0.03125. Thus, while observing M=0 takes the probability of the query down to 0%, we started out very close to 0%! And observing M=1 results in only a small uptick, to about 6% because there remain many type combinations consistent with M=1 but that do not fit through the needle-eye of this query. -->
