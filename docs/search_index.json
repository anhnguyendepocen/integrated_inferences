We describe major families of questions and illustrate how these can all be described as queries about the values of nodes in a causal model. :::: A general interest in causality masks tremendous heterogeneity in the kinds of causal questions that scholars tend to ask. Consider the relationship between inequality and democratization. We might seek, for instance, to know inequality’s average impact on democratization across some set of cases. Alternatively, we might be interested in a particular case—say, Mongolia in 1995—and want to know whether this is a context in which inequality has an effect—a question about causal effects at the case level. Relatedly—but distinctly—we might wonder whether the level of democracy in Mongolia in 1995 is causally attributable to the level of inequality in that case. And we may be interested in how causal effects unfold, inquiring about the pathway or mechanism through which inequality affects democratization—a question we can also ask at two levels. We can ask whether inequality affected democratization in Mongolia through mobilization of the masses; and we can ask how commonly inequality affects democratization through mobilization across a broad set of cases. Pushing further we might ask whether inequality would have produced democratization if mobilization was prevented from occurring. Rather separate methodological literatures have been devoted to the study of average causal effects, the analysis of case-level causal effects and explanations, and the identification of causal pathways. It is typically understood that their analysis requires quite distinct sets of tools. In this chapter, we take a key integrative step in showing that each of these queries can be readily captured in a causal model. More specifically, we demonstrate how causal queries can be represented as question about one or more nodes on a causal graph. When we assimilate our causal questions into a causal model, we are placing what we want to know in formal relation to both what we already know and what we can potentially observe. As we will see in later chapters, this move allows us then to deploy the model to generate strategies of inference: to determine which observations, if we made them, would be likely to yield the greatest leverage on our query, given our prior knowledge about the way the world works. And by the same logic, once we see the evidence, this integration allows us to “update” on our query—figure out in systematic fashion what we have learned—in a manner that takes background knowledge into account. In the remainder of this chapter, we walk through the conceptualization and causal-model interpretation of five key causal queries: Case-level causal effects Case-level causal attribution Case-level explanation Average causal effects Causal pathways These five are not exhaustive of the causal questions that can be captured in causal graphs, but they are among the more common foci of social scientific investigation. 4.1 Case-level causal effects The simplest causal question is whether some causal effect operates in an individual case. Does \\(X\\) have an effect on \\(Y\\) in this case? For instance, is Yemen in 1995 a case in which a change in economic inequality would produce a change in whether or not the country democratizes? We could put the question more specifically as a query about a causal effect in a particular direction, for instance: Does inequality have a positive effect on democratization in the case of Yemen in 1995? In counterfactual terms, a query about case-level causation is a question about what would happen if we could manipulate a variable in the case: if we could hypothetically intervene to change \\(X\\)’s value in the case, (how) would \\(Y\\)’s value change? To ask whether a positive (or negative) effect operates for a case is to ask whether a particular counterfactual relation holds in that case. If we assume a setup with binary variables for simplicity, to ask whether inequality has a positive effect on democratization is to ask: if we set \\(I\\) to \\(0\\) would \\(D\\) take on a value of \\(0\\), and if we set \\(I\\) to \\(1\\), would \\(D\\) take on a value of \\(1\\)? (Both of these conditions must hold for \\(I\\) to have a positive effect on \\(D\\).) We can easily represent this kind of query in the context of a causal model. We show the DAG for such a model in Figure . As introduced in Chapter 6, \\(\\theta^Y\\) here represents the nodal type characterizing \\(Y\\)’s response to \\(X\\) and, if \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are binary, can take on one of four values: \\(\\theta^Y_{10}\\), \\(\\theta^Y_{01}\\), \\(\\theta^Y_{00}\\), and \\(\\theta^Y_{11}\\) (which map onto our \\(a, b, c\\) and \\(d\\) types, respectively). Importantly, given that the value of nodes (or variables) is allowed to vary across cases, this setup allows for \\(\\theta^Y\\)—the causal effect of \\(X\\) on \\(Y\\)—to vary across cases. Thus, \\(X\\) may have a positive effect on \\(Y\\) in one case (with \\(\\theta^Y=\\theta^Y_{01}\\)), and a negative (\\(\\theta^Y=\\theta^Y_{10}\\)) or no effect (\\(\\theta^Y=\\theta^Y_{00}\\) or \\(\\theta^Y_{11}\\)) on \\(Y\\) in other cases. Figure 4.1: This DAG is a graphical representation of the simple causal setup in which the effect of \\(X\\) on \\(Y\\) in a given case depends on the case’s nodal type, represented by \\(\\theta^Y\\). With a single binary causal variable of interest, we let \\(\\theta^Y\\) take on values \\(\\theta^Y_{ij}\\), with \\(i\\) representing the value \\(Y\\) takes on if \\(X=0\\) and \\(j\\) representing the value \\(Y\\) takes on if \\(X=1\\). With a binary framework outcome, \\(\\theta^Y\\) ranges over the four values: \\(\\theta^Y_{00}\\), \\(\\theta^Y_{10}\\), \\(\\theta^Y_{01}\\) and \\(\\theta^Y_{11}\\). In this model, then, the query, “What is \\(X\\)’s causal effect in this case?” simply becomes a question about the value of the nodal type \\(\\theta^Y\\). A natural way to interpret this question would be, “What is the expected effect of \\(X\\) on \\(Y\\)?” Answering this question requires estimating the probability that \\(X\\) has a positive efefct minus the probability that it has a negative effect: \\(\\Pr(\\theta^Y = \\theta^Y_{01}) - \\Pr(\\theta^Y = \\theta^Y_{10})\\). We can also readily conceptualize this same question in a more complex model, as a question about a more complex function of nodal type probabilities. For instance, consider a mediation model of the form \\(X\\rightarrow M \\rightarrow Y\\). In this model, a positive effect of \\(X\\) on \\(Y\\) can emerge either from a chain of positive effects of \\(X\\) on \\(M\\) and of \\(M\\) on \\(Y\\) or from a chain of negative effects, while a negative effect of \\(X\\) on \\(Y\\) can emerge from a chain of opposite-signed effects. Thus, answering the question means estimating: \\[\\Pr((\\theta^M = \\theta^M_{01} \\&amp; \\theta^Y = \\theta^Y_{01}) | (\\theta^M = \\theta^M_{10} \\&amp; \\theta^Y = \\theta^Y_{10})) - \\Pr((\\theta^M = \\theta^M_{01} \\&amp; \\theta^Y = \\theta^Y_{10}) | (\\theta^M = \\theta^M_{10} \\&amp; \\theta^Y = \\theta^Y_{01}))\\] Of course, these \\(\\theta\\)s are not directly observable: nodal types are intrinsically unobserved properties of cases. So, as we will see in later chapters, research design becomes a challenge of determining which observable nodes in the graph are potentially informative about the unobservable nodes that constitute our causal queries. 4.2 Case-level causal attribution A query about causal attribution is related to, but different from, a query about a case-level causal effect. When asking about \\(X\\)’s case-level effect, we are asking, “Would a change in \\(X\\) cause a change in \\(Y\\) in this case?” The question of causal attribution is slightly different: “Did \\(X\\) cause \\(Y\\) to take on the value it did in this case?” More precisely, we are asking, “Given the values that \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) in fact took on in this case, would \\(Y\\)’s value have been different if \\(X\\)’s value had been different?” For instance, given that we know that inequality in Taiwan was relatively low and that Taiwan democratized in 1996, was low inequality a cause of Taiwan’s democratization in 1996? Put differently, given low economic inequality and democratization in Taiwan in 1996, would the outcome in this case have been different if inequality had been high? This goes beyond simply asking whether Taiwan is a case in which inequality has a causal effect on democratization. Whereas a case-level causal effect is defined in terms of the \\(\\theta\\) nodes on endogenous variables, we define a causal-attribution query in terms of a larger set of nodes. To attribute \\(Y\\)’s value in a case to \\(X\\), we need to know not only whether this is the kind of case in which \\(X\\) could have an effect on \\(Y\\) but also whether the context is such that \\(X\\)’s value in fact made a difference. Consider, for instance, the general setup in Figure 4.2. Here, \\(Y\\) is a function of two variables, \\(X_1\\) and \\(X_2\\). This means that \\(\\theta^Y\\) is somewhat more complicated than in a setup with one causal variable: \\(\\theta^Y\\) must here define \\(Y\\)’s response to all possible combinations of \\(X_1\\) and \\(X_2\\), including interactions between them. Figure 4.2: This DAG is a graphical representation of the simple causal setup in which \\(Y\\) depends on two variables \\(X1\\) and \\(X2\\). How \\(Y\\) responds to X1 and X2 depnds on \\(\\theta^Y\\), the DAG itself does not provide information on whether or how X1 and X2 interact with each other. We examined the set of nodal types for a set up like this in Chapter 2 (see Table ??). In the table, there are four column headings representing the four possible combinations of \\(X_1\\) and \\(X_2\\) values. Each row represents one possible pattern of \\(Y\\) values as \\(X1\\) and \\(X2\\) move through their four combinations. One way to conceptualize the size of the nodal-type “space” is to note that \\(X_1\\) can have any of our four causal effects (the four binary types) on \\(Y\\) when \\(X_2=0\\); and \\(X_1\\) can have any of four causal effects when \\(X_2=1\\).1 This yields 16 possible response patterns to combinations of \\(X_1\\) and \\(X_2\\) values. A query about causal attribution—whether \\(X_1 = 1\\) caused \\(Y=1\\)—for the model in Figure 4.2, needs to be defined in terms of both \\(X_2\\) and \\(\\theta^Y\\). Parallel to our Taiwan example, suppose that we have a case in which \\(Y=1\\) and in which \\(X_1\\) was also 1, and we want to know whether \\(X_1\\) caused \\(Y\\) to take on the value it did. Answering this question requires knowing whether the case’s type is such that \\(X_1\\) would have had a positive causal effect on \\(Y\\), given the value of \\(X_2\\) (which we can think of as part of the context). Thus, given that we start with knowledge of \\(X_1\\)’s and \\(Y\\)’s values, our query about causal attribution amounts to a query about two nodal types: (a) \\(\\theta^{X_2}\\) (which gives \\(X_2\\)’s value) and (b) \\(\\theta^Y\\), specifically whether its value is such that \\(X_1\\) has a positive causal effect given \\(X_2\\)’s value. Suppose, for instance, that we were to observe \\(X_2=1\\). We then need to ask whether the nodal type, \\(\\theta^Y\\), is such that \\(X_1\\) has a positive effect when \\(X_2=1\\). Consider \\(\\theta^Y_{0111}\\) (type 8 in Table ??).2 This is a nodal type in which \\(X_1\\) has a positive effect when \\(X_2=0\\) but no effect when \\(X_2=1\\). Put differently, \\(X_2=1\\) is a sufficient condition for \\(Y=1\\), meaning that \\(X_1\\) makes no difference to the outcome when \\(X_2=1\\). In all we have four qualifying \\(Y\\)-types: \\(\\theta^Y_{0001}\\), \\(\\theta^Y_{1001}\\), \\(\\theta^Y_{0101}\\), \\(\\theta^Y_{1101}\\). In other words, we can attribute a \\(Y=1\\) outcome to \\(X_1=1\\) when \\(X_2=1\\) and \\(Y\\)’s nodal type is one of these four. Thus, a question about causal attribution is a question about the joint value of a set of nodal types: about whether the combination of context and the nodal type(s) governing effects is such that changing the causal factor of interest would have changed the outcome. 4.3 Actual causes So far we have been dealing with causes in the standard counterfactual sense: antecedent conditions a change in which would have produced a different outcome. Sometimes, however, we are interested in identifying antecedent conditions that were not counterfactual difference-makers but that nonetheless generated or produced the outcome. Consider, for instance, a situation in which an outcome was overdetermined: multiple conditions were present, each of which on their own, could have generated the outcome. Then none of these conditions caused the outcome in the counterfactual sense; yet one or more of them may have been distinctively important in producing the outcome. The concept of an actual cause can be useful in putting a finer point on this kind of causal question. A motivating example used in much of the literature on actual causes (e.g. Hall 2004) imagines two characters, Sally and Billy, simultaneously throwing stones at a bottle. Both are excellent shots and hit whatever they aim at. Sally’s stone hits first, and so the bottle breaks. However, Billy’s stone would have hit had Sally’s not hit, and would have broken the bottle. Did Sally’s throw cause the bottle to break? Did Billy’s? By the usual definition of causal effects, neither Sally’s nor Billy’s action had a causal effect: without either throw, the bottle would still have broken. We commonly encounter similar situations in the social world. We observe, for instance, the onset of an economic crisis and the breakout of war—either of which would be sufficient to cause the government’s downfall—but with (say) the economic crisis occurring first and toppling the government before the war could do so. In this situation, neither economic crisis nor war in fact made a difference to the outcome: take away either one and the outcome remains the same. To return to the bottle example, while neither Sally’s nor Billy’s throw is a counterfactual cause, there is an important sense in which Sally’s action obviously broke the bottle, and Billy’s did not. We can formalize this intuition by defining Sally’s throw as the actual cause of the outcome. Using the definition provided by (Halpern 2015), building on (Halpern and Pearl 2005) and others, we say that a condition (\\(X\\) taking on some value \\(x\\)) was an actual cause of an outcome (of \\(Y\\) taking on some value \\(y\\)), where \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) may be collections of events, if: \\(X=x\\) and \\(Y=y\\) both happened there is some set of variables, \\(\\mathcal W\\), such that if they were fixed at the levels that they actually took in the case, and if \\(X\\) were to be changed, then \\(Y\\) would change (where \\(\\mathcal W\\) can also be an empty set) no strict subset of \\(X\\) satisfies 1 and 2 (there is no redundant part of the condition, \\(X=x\\)) The definition thus describes a condition that would have been a counterfactual cause of the outcome if we were to imagine holding constant some set of events that in fact occurred (and that, in reality, might not have been constant if the actual cause had not in fact occurred). Let us now qpply these 3 conditions to the Sally and Billy example. Conditions 1 and 3 are easily satisfied, since Sally throw and the bottle break (Condition 1), and “Sally threw” has no strict subsets (Condition 3). Condition 2 is met if Sally’s throw made a difference, counterfactually speaking — with the important caveat that, in determining this, we are permitted to condition on (to fix in the counterfactual comparison) any event or set of events that actually happened (or on on none at all). To see why Condition 2 is satisfied, we have to think of there being three steps in the process: (1) Sally and Billy throw, (2) Sally’s or Billy’s rock hits the bottle, and (3) the bottle breaks. In actuality, Billy’s stone did not hit the bottle, so we are allowed to condition on that fact in determining whether Sally’s throw was a counterfactual cause. Conditioning on Billy’s stone not hitting, the bottle would not have broken had Sally not thrown. From the perspective of counterfactual causation, it may seem odd to condition on Billy’s stone not hitting the bottle when thinking about Sally not throwing the stone—since Sally’s throwing the stone was the very thing that prevented Billy from hitting the bottle. Yet Halpern argues that this is an acceptable thought experiment for establishing the importance of Sally’s throw since conditioning is constrained to the actual facts of the case. Moreover, the same logic shows why Billy is not an actual cause. The reason is that Billy’s throw is only a cause in those conditions in which Sally did not hit the bottle. But because Sally actually hit the bottle, we are not permitted to condition on Sally not hitting the bottle in determining actual causation. We thus cannot—even through conditioning on actually occurring events—construct any counterfactual comparison in which Billy’s throw is a counterfactual cause of the bottle’s breaking. The striking result here is that there can be grounds to claim that a condition was the actual cause of an outcome even though, under the counterfactual definition, the effect of that condition on the outcome is 0. (At the same time, all counterfactual causes are automatically actual causes; they meet Condition 2 by conditioning on nothing at all, an empty set \\(\\mathcal W\\).) One immediate methodological implication follows: since actual causes need not be causes, there are risks in research designs that seek to understand causal effects by tracing back actual causes—i.e., the way things actually happened. If we traced back from the breaking of the bottle, we might be tempted to identify Sally’s throw as the cause of the outcome. We would be right only in an actual-causal sense, but wrong in the standard, counterfactual causal sense. Chains of events that appear to “generate” an outcome are not always causes in that sense.3 As with other causal queries, the question “Was \\(X=x\\) the actual cause of \\(Y=y\\)?” can be redefined as a question about which combinations of nodal types produce conditions under which \\(X\\) could have made a difference. To see how, let us run through the Billy and Sally example again, but formally in terms of a model. Consider Figure , where we represent Sally’s throw (\\(S\\)), Billy’s throw (\\(B\\)), Sally’s rock hitting the bottle (\\(H^S\\)), Billy’s rock hitting the bottle (\\(H^B\\)), and the bottle cracking (\\(C\\)). Each endogenous variable has a \\(\\theta\\) term associated with it, capturing its nodal type. We capture the possible “preemption” effect with the arrow pointing from \\(H^S\\) to \\(H^B\\), allowing whether Sally’s rock hits to affect whether Billy’s rock hits.4 For Sally’s throw to be an actual cause of the bottle’s cracking, we need first to establish that Sally threw (\\(\\theta^S=\\theta^S_1\\)) and that the bottle cracked (\\(\\theta^C=\\theta^C_1\\)) (Condition 1). Condition 3 is automatically satisfied in that \\(\\theta^S=\\theta^S_1\\) has no strict subsets. Turning now to Condition 2, we need Sally’s throw to be a counterfactual cause of the bottle cracking if we condition on the value of some set of nodes remaining fixed at the values they in fact took on. As discussed above, we know that we can meet this criterion if we condition on Billy’s throw not hitting. To make this work, we need to ensure, first, that Sally’s throw hits if and only if she throws: so \\(\\theta^{H^S}=\\theta^{H^S}_{01}\\). Next, we need to ensure that Billy’s throw does not hit whenever Sally’s does: this corresponds to any of the four nodal types for \\(H^B\\) that take the form \\(\\theta^{H^B}_{xx00}\\), meaning that \\(H^B=0\\) whenever \\(H^S=1\\). Note that the effect of Billy throwing on Billy hitting when Sally has not thrown—the first two terms in the nodal-type’s subscript—does not matter since we have already selected a value for \\(\\theta^S\\) such that Sally does indeed throw. Finally, we need \\(\\theta^C\\) to take on a value such that \\(H^S\\) has a positive effect on \\(C\\) when \\(H^B=0\\) (Billy doesn’t hit) since this is the actual circumstance on which we will be conditioning. This is satisfied by any of the four nodal types of the form \\(\\theta^C_{0x1x}\\). This includes, for instance, a \\(\\theta^C\\) value in which Billy’s hitting has no effect on the bottle (perhaps Billy doesn’t throw hard enough!): e.g., \\(\\theta^C_{0011}\\). Here, Sally’s throw is a counterfactual cause of the bottle’s cracking. And, as we have said, all counterfactual causes are actual causes. They are, simply, counterfactual causes when we hold nothing fixed (\\(\\mathcal W\\) in Condition 2 is just the empty set). Notably, we do not need to specify the nodal type for \\(B\\): given the other nodal types identified, Sally’s throw will be the actual cause regardless of whether or not Billy throws. If Billy does not throw, then Sally’s throw is a simple counterfactual cause (given the other nodal types). The larger point is that actual cause queries can, like all other causal queries, be defined as questions about the values of nodes in a causal model. When we pose the query, was Sally’s throw an actual cause of the bottle cracking, we are in effect asking whether the case’s combination of nodal types (or its causal type) matches \\(\\theta^S_1, \\theta^B_x, \\theta^{H^B}_{xx00}, \\theta^{H^S}_{01}, \\theta^C_{0x1x}\\). Likewise, if want to ask how often Sally’s throw is an actual cause, in a population of throwing rounds, we can address this query as a question about the joint distribution of nodal types. We are then asking how common the qualifying combinations of nodal types are in the population given the distribution of types at each node. Figure 4.3: This DAG is a graphical representation of the simple causal setup in which the effect of \\(X\\) on \\(Y\\) in a given case depends on the case’s nodal type, represented by \\(\\theta^Y\\). With a single binary causal variable of interest, we let \\(\\theta^Y\\) take on values \\(\\theta^Y_{ij}\\), with \\(i\\) representing the value \\(Y\\) takes on if \\(X=0\\) and \\(j\\) representing the value \\(Y\\) takes on if \\(X=1\\). With a binary framework outcome, \\(\\theta^Y\\) ranges over the four values: \\(\\theta^Y_{00}\\), \\(\\theta^Y_{10}\\), \\(\\theta^Y_{01}\\) and \\(\\theta^Y_{11}\\). Actual causes are conceptually useful whenever there are two sufficient causes for an outcome, but one preempts the operation of the other. For instance, we might posit that both the United States’ development of the atomic bomb was a sufficient condition for U.S. victory over Japan in World War II, and that U.S. conventional military superiority was also a sufficient condition and would have operated via a land invasion of Japan. Neither condition was a counterfactual cause of the outcome because both were present. However, holding constant the absence of a land invasion, the atomic bomb was a difference-maker, rendering it an actual cause. The concept of actual cause thus helps capture the sense in which the atomic bomb distinctively contributed to the outcome, even if it was not a counterfactual cause. An extended notion (Halpern 2016, p 81) of actual causes restricts the imagined counterfactual deviations to states that are more likely to arise (more “normal”) than the factual state. We will call this notion a “notable cause.” We can say that one cause, \\(A\\), is “more notable” than another cause, \\(B\\), if a deviation in \\(A\\) from its realized state is (believed to be) more likely than a deviation in \\(B\\) from its realized state. For intuition, we might wonder why a Republican was elected to the presidency in a given election. In looking at some minimal winning coalition of states that voted Republican, we might distinguish between a set of states that always vote Republican and a set of states that usually go Democratic but voted Republican this time. If the coalition is minimal winning, then every state that voted Republican is a cause of the outcome in the standard (difference-making) sense. However, only the states that usually vote Democratic are notable causes since it is only for them that the counterfactual scenario (voting Democratic) was more likely to arise than the factual scenario. In a sense, we take the “red” states’ votes for the Republican as given—placing them, as it were, in the causal background—and identify as “notable” those conditions that mattered and easily could have gone differently. By the same token, we can say that, among those states that voted Republican this time, those that more commonly vote Democratic are more notable causes than those that less commonly vote Democratic. How notable a counterfactual cause is can be expressed as a claim about the distribution of a set of nodal types. For instance, if we observe \\(R^j=1\\) for state \\(j\\) (it voted Republican), then the notability of this vote directly increases in our belief about the probability that \\(\\theta^{R^j}=\\theta_0^{R^j}\\): the probability that the state’s vote could have gone the other way. 4.4 Average causal effects A more general query asks about an average causal effect in some population. In counterfactual terms, a question about average causal effects is: if we manipulated the value of \\(X\\) for all cases in the population—first setting \\(X\\) to one value for all cases, then changing it to another value for all cases—by how much would the average value of \\(Y\\) in the population change? Like other causal queries, a query about an average causal effect can be conceptualized as learning about a node in a causal model. We can do this by conceiving of any given case as being a member of a population composed of different nodal types. When we seek to estimate an average causal effect, we seek information about the shares of these nodal types in the population. More formally and adapted from Humphreys and Jacobs (2015), we can use \\(\\lambda^Y_{ij}\\) to refer to the share of cases in a population that has nodal type \\(\\theta^Y_{ij}\\). Thus, given our four nodal types in a two-variable binary setup, \\(\\lambda^Y_{10}\\) is the proportion of cases in the population with negative effects; \\(\\lambda_{01}\\) is the proportion of cases with positive effects; and so on. One nice feature of this setup, with both \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) as binary, is that the average causal effect can be simply calculated as the share of positive-effect cases less the share of negative-effect cases: \\(\\lambda^Y_{01} - \\lambda^Y_{10}\\). Graphically, we can represent this setup by including \\(\\lambda^Y\\) in a more complex causal graph as in Figure . As in our setup for case-level causal effects, \\(X\\)’s effect on \\(Y\\) in a case depends on (and only on) the case’s nodal type, \\(\\theta^Y\\). The key difference is that we now model the case’s type not as exogenously given, but as a function of two additional variables: the distribution of nodal types in a population and a random process through which the case’s type is “drawn” from that distribution. We represent the type distribution as \\(\\lambda^Y\\) (a vector of values for the proportions \\(\\lambda^Y_{10}, \\lambda^Y_{01}, \\lambda^Y_{00}, \\lambda^Y_{11}\\)) and the random process drawing a \\(\\theta^Y\\) value from that distribution as \\(U^\\theta\\). In this model, our causal query—about \\(X\\)’s average causal effect—is thus defined by the vector \\(\\lambda^Y\\), and specifically by the shares of negative- and positive-causal-effect cases, respectively, in the population. What is \\(X\\)’s average effect on \\(Y\\) amounts to asking: what are the values of \\(\\lambda^Y_{10}\\) and \\(\\lambda^Y_{01}\\)? As with \\(\\theta^Y\\), \\(\\lambda^Y\\) is not directly observable. And so the empirical challenge is to figure out what we can observe that would allow us to learn about \\(\\lambda^Y\\)’s component values?5 Figure 4.4: This DAG is a graphical representation of a causal setup in which cases are drawn from a population composed of different nodal types. As before, \\(X\\)’s effect on \\(Y\\) is a function of a causal-type variable, \\(\\theta^Y\\). Yet here we explicitly model the process through which the case’s type is drawn from a distribution of types in a population. The variable \\(\\lambda\\) is a vector representing the multinomial distribution of nodal types in the population while \\(U^\\theta\\) is a random variable representing the draw of each case from the distribution defined by \\(\\lambda\\). A case’s nodal type, \\(\\theta^Y\\), is thus a joint function of \\(\\lambda^Y\\) and \\(U^{\\theta^Y}\\). We can, of course, likewise pose queries about other population-level causal quantities. For instance, we could ask for what proportion of cases in the population \\(X\\) has a positive effect: this would be equivalent to asking the value of \\(\\lambda^Y_{01}\\), one element of the \\(\\lambda^Y\\) vector. Or we could ask about the proportion of cases in which \\(X\\) has no effect, which would be asking about \\(\\lambda^Y_{00} + \\lambda^Y_{11}\\). 4.5 Causal Paths To develop richer causal understandings, researchers often seek to describe the causal path or paths through which effects propagate. Consider the DAG in Figure 4.5, in which \\(X\\) can affect \\(Y\\) through two possible pathways: directly and via \\(M\\). Assume again that all variables are binary, taking on values of \\(0\\) or \\(1\\). Here we have nodal types defining \\(M\\)’s response to \\(X\\) (\\(\\theta^M\\)) and defining \\(Y\\)’s response to both \\(X\\) (directly) and \\(M\\) (\\(\\theta^Y\\)). Suppose that we observe \\(X=1\\) and \\(Y=1\\) in a case. Suppose, further, that we have reasonable confidence that \\(X\\) has had a positive effect on \\(Y\\) in this case. We may nonetheless be interested in knowing whether that causal effect ran through \\(M\\). We will refer to this as a query about a causal path. Importantly, a causal path query is not satisfied simply by asking whether some mediating event along the path occurred. We cannot, for instance, establish that the top path in Figure was operative simply by determining the value of \\(M\\) in this case—though that will likely be useful information. Rather, the question of whether the mediated (via \\(M\\)) causal path is operative is a composite question of two parts: First, does \\(X\\) have an effect on \\(M\\) in this case? Second, does that effect—the difference in \\(M\\)’s value caused by a change in \\(X\\)—in turn cause a change in \\(Y\\)’s value? In other words, what we want to know is whether the effect of \\(X\\) on \\(Y\\) depends on—that is, will not operate without—the effect of \\(X\\) on \\(M\\).6 Framing the query in this way makes clear that asking whether a causal effect operated via a given path is in fact asking about a specific set of causal effects lying along that path. Figure 4.5: Here \\(X\\) has effects on \\(Y\\) both indirectly through \\(M\\) and directly. As we can show, we can define this causal-path query as a question about specific nodes on a causal graph. In particular, a causal path can be defined in terms of the values of \\(\\theta\\) nodes: specifically, in the present example, in terms of \\(\\theta^M\\) and \\(theta^Y\\). To see why, let us first note that there are two combinations of effects that would allow \\(X\\)’s positive effect on \\(Y\\) to operate via \\(M\\): (1) \\(X\\) has a positive effect on \\(M\\), which in turn has a positive effect on \\(Y\\); or (2) \\(X\\) has a negative effect on \\(M\\), which has a negative effect on \\(Y\\). Thus, in establishing whether \\(X\\) affects \\(Y\\) through \\(M\\), the first question is whether \\(X\\) affects \\(M\\) in this case. Whether or not it does is a question about the value of \\(\\theta^M\\). We know that \\(\\theta^M\\) can take on four possible values corresponding to the four possible responses to \\(X\\): \\(\\theta^M_{10}, \\theta^M_{01}, \\theta^M_{00}, \\theta^M_{11}\\). For sequence (1) to operate, \\(\\theta^M\\) must take on the value \\(\\theta^M_{01}\\), representing a positive effect of \\(X\\) on \\(M\\). For sequence (2) to operate, \\(\\theta^M\\) must take on the value \\(\\theta^M_{10}\\), representing a negative effect of \\(X\\) on \\(M\\). \\(\\theta^Y\\) defines \\(Y\\)’s response to different combinations of two other variables—here, \\(X\\) and \\(M\\)—since both of these variables point directly into \\(Y\\). Where \\(X\\) can have both a mediated effect through \\(M\\) and a direct effect, \\(X\\) and \\(M\\) also potentially interact in affecting \\(Y\\). Another way to think about this setup is that \\(M\\) is not just a possible mediator of \\(X\\)’s indirect effect; \\(M\\) is also a potential moderator of \\(X\\)’s direct effect. This results in sixteeen possible values for \\(\\theta^Y\\)—again as shown above in Table ??. What values of \\(\\theta^Y\\) then are compatible with the operation of the \\(M\\) causal path? Let us first consider this question with respect to sequence (1), in which \\(X\\) has a positive effect on \\(M\\), and that positive effect is necessary for \\(X\\)’s positive effect on \\(Y\\) to occur. For this sequence to operate, \\(\\theta^M\\) must take on the value of \\(\\theta^M_{01}\\). When it comes to \\(\\theta^Y\\), then, what we need to look for types in which \\(X\\)’s effect on \\(Y\\) depends on \\(M\\)’s taking on the value it does as a result of \\(X\\)’s positive effect on \\(M\\). We are thus looking for nodal types that capture two kinds of counterfactual causal relations operating on nodes. First, \\(X\\) must have a positive effect on \\(Y\\) when \\(M\\) changes as it does as a result of \\(X\\)’s positive effect on \\(M\\). Second, that change in \\(M\\), generated by a change in \\(X\\), must be necessary for \\(X\\)’s positive effect on \\(Y\\) to operate. The thought experiment here thus imagines a situation in which \\(X\\) changes from \\(0\\) to \\(1\\),7 but \\(M\\) does not change to the value that it should as a result of this change in \\(X\\). We then inspect our types to see if \\(Y\\) would change from \\(0\\) to \\(1\\) in this situation. It is only if \\(Y\\) would not change to \\(1\\) in this situation that we have identified a nodal type for which the \\(M\\)-mediated path matters. It is this thought experiment that isolates the causal significance of the path that runs through \\(M\\). Assuming a positive effect of \\(X\\) on \\(M\\) (\\(\\theta^M=\\theta^M_{01}\\)), we thus need to apply the following set of queries to \\(\\theta^Y\\):8 Is \\(X=1\\) a counterfactual cause of \\(Y=1\\), given \\(X\\)’s positive effect on \\(M\\)? Establishing this positive effect of \\(X\\) involves two queries: Where \\(X=0\\), does \\(Y=0\\)? As we are assuming \\(X\\) has a positive effect on \\(M\\), if \\(X=0\\) then \\(M=0\\) as well. We thus look down the \\(X=0, M=0\\) column and eliminate those types in which we do not observe \\(Y=0\\). This eliminates types \\(9\\) through \\(16\\). Where \\(X=1\\), does \\(Y=1\\)? Again, given \\(X\\)’s assumed positive effect on \\(M\\), \\(M=1\\) under this condition. Looking down the \\(X=1, M=1\\) column, we eliminate those types where we do not see \\(Y=1\\). We retain only types \\(2, 4, 6,\\) and \\(8\\). Is \\(X\\)’s effect on \\(M\\) necessary for \\(X\\)’s positive effect on \\(Y\\)? That is, do we see \\(Y=1\\) only if \\(M\\) takes on the value that \\(X=1\\) generates (\\(M=1\\))? To determine this, we inspect the counterfactual condition in which \\(X=1\\) and \\(M=0\\), and we ask: does \\(Y=0\\)? Of the four remaining types, only \\(2\\) and \\(6\\) pass this test. Under these and only these two values of \\(\\theta^Y\\)—\\(\\theta^Y_{0001}\\) and \\(\\theta^Y_{0101}\\)—we will see a positive effect of \\(X\\) on \\(Y\\) for which the \\(M\\)-mediated path is causally necessary, given a positve effect of \\(X\\) on \\(M\\). These two \\(\\theta^Y\\) values are also different from one another in an interesting way. For type \\(\\theta^Y_{0101}\\), \\(X\\)’s effect on \\(Y\\) runs strictly through \\(M\\): if \\(M\\) were to change from \\(0\\) to \\(1\\) without \\(X\\) changing, \\(Y\\) would still change from \\(0\\) to \\(1\\). \\(X\\) is causally important for \\(Y\\) only insofar as it affects \\(M\\). In a case of type \\(\\theta^Y_{0101}\\), then, anything else that similarly affects \\(M\\) would generate the same effect on \\(Y\\) as \\(X\\) does. In type \\(\\theta^Y_{0001}\\), however, both \\(X\\)’s change to \\(1\\) and the resulting change in \\(M\\) are necessary to generate \\(Y\\)’s change to \\(1\\); \\(X\\)’s causal effect thus requires both the mediated and the unmediated pathway. And here \\(X\\) itself matters in the counterfactual sense; for a case of type \\(\\theta^Y_{0001}\\), some other cause of \\(M\\) would not generate the same effect on \\(Y\\). We can undertake the same exercise for sequence (2), in which \\(X\\) first has a negative effect on \\(M\\), or \\(\\theta^M=\\theta^M_{10}\\). Here we adjust the three queries for \\(\\theta^Y\\) to take account of this negative effect. Thus, we adjust query 1a so that we are looking for \\(Y=0\\) when \\(X=0\\) and \\(M=1\\). In query 1b, we look for \\(Y=1\\) when \\(X=1\\) and \\(M=0\\). And for query 2, we want types in which \\(Y\\) fails to shift to \\(1\\) when \\(X\\) shifts to \\(1\\) but \\(M\\) stays at \\(1\\). Types \\(\\theta_{0010}\\) and \\(\\theta_{1010}\\) pass these three tests. In sum, we can define a query about causal paths as a query about the value of \\(\\theta\\) terms on the causal graph. For the graph in Figure , asking whether \\(X\\)’s effect runs via the \\(M\\)-mediated path is asking whether one of four combinations of \\(\\theta^M\\) and \\(\\theta^Y\\) hold in case: \\(\\theta^M=\\theta^M_{01}\\) and (\\(\\theta^Y=\\theta_{0001}\\) or \\(\\theta_{0101}\\)) \\(\\theta^M=\\theta^M_{10}\\) and (\\(\\theta^Y=\\theta_{0010}\\) or \\(\\theta_{1010}\\)) It is worth noting how different this formulation of the task of identifying causal pathways is from widespread understandings of process tracing. Scholars commonly characterize process tracing as a method in which we determine whether a mechanism was operating by establishing whether the events lying along that path occurred. As a causal-model framework makes clear, finding out that \\(M=1\\) (or \\(M=0\\), for that matter) does not establish what was going on causally. Observing this intervening step does not by itself tell us what value \\(M\\) would have taken on if \\(X\\) had taken on a different value, or whether this would have changed \\(Y\\)’s value. We need instead to conceive of the problem of identifying pathways as one of figuring out the counterfactual response patterns of the variables along the causal chain. As we will demonstrate later in the book, explicitly characterizing those response patterns as nodes in a causal model helps us think systematically about empirical strategies for drawing the relevant inferences.
