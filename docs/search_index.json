Lower-level models serve as a theory for a higher level model if the higher level model can be deduced from the lower level modelpossibly in combination with data. Consistency requirements determine what new theory emerges from the combination of prior theory and data, but also constrain what prior theories can be invoked to justify a given claim. In Chapter 3, we worked with a set of theories. But we havent yet been very explicit by what we mean by a theory or how theory maps onto a causal-model framework. In this book, we will think of theory as a type of explanation: a theory provides an account of how or under what conditions a set of causal relationships operate. We generally express both a theory and the claims being theorized as causal models. The theory is then is a model that implies another modelpossibly with the help of some data. To fix ideas: a simple claim might be that A caused B in case \\(j\\). This claim is itself a model, albeit a very simple one. The theory that supports this model might be of the form A always causes B, A always causes B whenever C (and C holds in case j), or A invariably causes B and invariably B causes C. All of which might be arguments provided to support the simple claim: if you believe the theory you believe the implication. The rest of this short chapter builds out this idea and uses it provide a way of characterizing when a theory is useful or not. In embedding theorization within the world of causal models, we ultimately have an empirical objective in mind. Theorizing a causal relationship of interest, in our framework, means elaborating our causal beliefs about the world in greater detail. As we show in later chapters, theorizing in the form of a causal model allows us to generate research designs: to identify sources of inferential leverage and to explicitly and systematically link observations of components of a causal system to the causal questions we seek to answer. 6.1 Models as theories of Let us say that a causal model, \\(M^\\prime\\), is a theory of \\(M\\) if \\(M\\) is implied by \\(M^\\prime\\). It is a theory because it has implications. Otherwise it is a conclusion, an inference, or claim. A theory, \\(M^\\prime\\), might itself sit atopbe supported byanother theory, \\(M^{\\prime\\prime}\\), that implies \\(M^\\prime\\). To help fix the idea of theory as supporting or underlying the model(s) it theorizes, we refer to the theory, \\(M^\\prime\\), as a lower-level model relative to \\(M\\) and refer to \\(M\\) as a higher-level model relative to its theorization, \\(M^\\prime\\).1 Both structural models and probabilistic modelspossibly in combination with dataimply other models. We discuss each in turn. 6.1.1 Implications of structural causal models Structural models can imply multiple other simpler structural models. Similarly structural models can be implied by multiple more involved models. Take the very simple model, \\(M\\), represented in Figure 6.1(a). The model simply states that \\(X\\) has (or can have) a causal effect on \\(Y\\). What theories might justify \\(M\\)? This question can be rephrased as what models imply model \\(M\\)? The figure points to two possibilities. Both models \\(M^\\prime\\) and \\(M^{\\prime\\prime}\\) imply model \\(M\\). They can be thought of as theories, or lower-level model, of \\(M\\). Model \\(M^\\prime\\) differs by the addition of a node, \\(K\\), in the causal chain between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\). We can say that \\(M^\\prime\\) is a theory of \\(M\\) for two reasons. First it provides a justificationif you believe \\(M^\\prime\\) you should believe \\(M\\): if \\(X\\) affects \\(Y\\) through \\(K\\), then \\(X\\) affects \\(Y\\). But as well as a justification it also provides an explanation of \\(M\\). Suppose we already know that \\(X\\) affects \\(Y\\) but want to know why. If we ask, why does \\(X\\) affect \\(Y\\)? \\(M^\\prime\\) provides an answer: \\(X\\) affects \\(Y\\) because \\(X\\) affects \\(K\\), and \\(K\\) affects \\(Y\\). Model \\(M^{\\prime\\prime}\\) differs by the addition of a node, \\(C\\), that moderates the effect of \\(X\\) on \\(Y\\). \\(M^{\\prime\\prime}\\) justifies \\(M\\) in the sense that if you believe \\(M^{\\prime\\prime}\\) you should believe \\(M\\). It provides an explanation of a kind also: if you believe model \\(M^{\\prime\\prime}\\) you likely believe that the relation between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) is what it is because of \\(C\\). Had \\(C\\) been different the causal relation between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) might have been also. A key idea, which we return to later, is that both \\(M&#39;\\) and \\(M&#39;&#39;\\) involve a redefinition of \\(\\theta^Y\\). That is we see a change in the endogenous nodes but these in turn imply a change in the interpretation of the exogenous nodes pointing into existing endogenous nodes (such as \\(Y\\) in this example). Figure 6.1: Here we represent the simple claim that one variable causes another, and two theories  lower-level models  that could explain this claim. Both model (b) and model (c) involve theorization via disaggregation of nodes. 6.1.2 Probabilistic causal models and the integration of theory and data A probabilistic model can also be implied by another probabilistic model, possibly coupled with data. Consider first implications without data. Causal Model (b) in Figure 6.1, coupled with a distribution over \\(\\theta^K\\) and \\(\\theta^Y_{higher}\\), produces a probabilistic causal model, \\(M_{lower}\\). It in turn implies a probabilistic model, \\(M_{lower}\\), formed from Causal Model (a) in Figure 6.1, and a particular distribution over \\(\\theta^Y_{lower}\\), that is, the distribution that preserves the causal relations implied by \\(M_{lower}\\). Thus, for instance, the probability that \\(X\\) has a positive effect on \\(Y\\) in \\(M_{higher}\\) is \\(\\theta^{Y_{higher}}_{01}\\); the probability that \\(X\\) has a positive effect on \\(Y\\) in \\(M_{lower}\\) is \\(\\theta^{M_{lower}}_{01}\\theta^{Y_{lower}}_{01} + \\theta^{M_{lower}}_{10}\\theta^{Y_{lower}}_{10}\\). COnsistency then requires that \\(\\theta^{M_{lower}}_{01}\\theta^{Y_{lower}}_{01} + \\theta^{M_{lower}}_{10}\\theta^{Y_{lower}}_{10} = \\theta^{Y_{higher}}_{01}\\) and so the value of \\(\\theta^{Y_{higher}}_{01}\\) is implied by \\(\\theta^{M_{lower}}_{01},\\theta^{Y_{lower}}_{01}, \\theta^{M_{lower}}_{10},\\theta^{Y_{lower}}_{10}\\), but not vice versa. A probabilisitc causal model coupled with data implies another model via Bayes rule. For this reason we can fruitfully think of an initial model as being a theory of an updated model, coupled with data. Thought of in this way we have clarity over what is meant when we turn to theory to support a claim, but also what is meant when we seek to justify a theory. We might imagine a scholar arguing: \\(M\\): \\(X\\) caused \\(Y\\) in country \\(j\\). When pushed for a justification for the claim they provide the lower level model: \\(M:\\) the average effect of \\(X\\) on \\(Y\\) in countries with feature \\(C=1\\) is 0.95, making it likely that \\(X\\) caused \\(Y\\) in this case. Here \\(M\\) is implied by \\(M\\) coupled with data \\(C=1\\). If pushed further as to why that theory is itself credible they might point to a lower level model consisting of structural model \\(X\\rightarrow Y \\leftarrow C\\) plus flat priors coupled with data on \\(X,Y\\) and \\(C\\). At each stage, as more justification is provided, the researcher formally provides lower level models. Moving up, as more data is provided, more specific higher level models emerge, justified by lower models plus data. These models are more specific in the sense that they are implied by the higher level models, plus data, but not vice versa. But they are also more also (generally) more specific in a second sense: that they make stronger statements about how causal processes operate.2 They place greater weight on a smaller set of causal claims.3 As the simplest illustration, we might imagine beginning with an \\(X\\rightarrow Y\\) model, \\(M_1\\), in which, \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are binary, and we we believe that \\(Y\\) possibly responds to \\(X\\). If we have flat priors over causal types, in the sense described in chapter @(bayes), then our prior uncertainty over the proposition that \\(X\\) causes \\(Y\\), under this model, is large; as is our uncertainty that \\(Y=1\\) is dues to \\(X=1\\) in a given case. In other words, given our theory, we are uncertain about the proposition \\(M_3\\): \\(X\\) caused \\(Y\\). However if we then receive a lot of data, \\(D\\), showing strong relations between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), then our updated model \\(M_2\\), formed from combining \\(D\\) and \\(M_1\\) allows us to infer that \\(X\\) caused \\(Y\\) in this case with greater certainty. Thus our new theory \\(M_2\\) is (a) formally similar to \\(M_1\\) (b) formed as a product of past theory plus evidence, here justified by \\(M_1\\) given data \\(D\\) and (c) capable of providing sharper implications than past theory.4 In this way, Bayesian updating provides a simple and coherent way of thinking about the integration of theory and data. 6.2 Consistency 6.2.1 Elaboration Theorization starts with the proliferation of substantive variablesadding beliefs about intervening steps in a causal process. But, critically, it also involves an accompanying disaggregation of unexplained variation. Addition and splitting thus go hand-in-hand: the insertion of a mediator between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) also involves the splitting of \\(Y\\)s type node (\\(\\theta_Y\\)). Two kinds of theories. Theories are lower-level causal models that explain or provide an account of a higher-level, simpler model. Two common forms of theorization involve disaggregation  for instance by articulating mediating and moderating relationshipsand generalization: The disaggregation of nodes. A single node in a higher-level model can be split into multiple nodes. For instance, for a higher-level model in which \\(X \\rightarrow Y \\leftarrow \\theta^Y\\): Mediation: A mediator, \\(M\\), can be introduced between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), thus splitting \\(\\theta^Y\\) into \\(\\theta^M\\) and \\(\\theta^{Y_\\text{lower}}\\). The mediation theory thus explains the \\(X \\rightarrow Y\\) relationship. Moderation: A component of \\(\\theta^Y\\) can be extracted and specified as a substantive variable. This variable is now a substantively conceptualized moderator of the \\(X \\rightarrow Y\\) relationship. The moderation theory thus provides a fuller explanation of why \\(X\\) has different effects on \\(Y\\) in different contexts. Generalization. A feature of context omitted and implicitly held constant in a higher-level model can be explicitly included in the model. The higher-level model is now explained as a special case of a more general set of causal relations. Other possible ways of elaborating a modelincluding adding antecedent conditionscauses of nodes that were exogenous in the higher-level model-and adding downstream effects: outcomes of nodes that were terminal in the higher-level model. Figure 6.2: A higher-level model and a lower-level model that is impermissible. The central principle governing allowable elaborations is that a lower-level model must not introduce dependencies between variables that were omitted in the higher-level model. We provide an example of a violation of this principle in Figure 6.2. We start with a higher-level model, in panel (a), in which inequality affects democratization through mobilization. We then elaborate the model in panel (b) by adding ethnic homogeneity as a moderator of mobilizations effect. However, because ethnic homogeneity is also modeled here as affecting inequality, we have now introduced a source of dependence between inequality and democratization that was omitted from the higher-level model. In panel (a), democratization and inequality were dependent only via mobilization; and so they are conditionally independent given mobilization. In panel (b), democratization and mobilization are additionally dependent via their common cause, ethnic homogeneity. By the rules governing causal graphs (see Chapter ), the higher-level model specifically prohibited this second source of dependencysince all dependencies between variables must be represented. Put differently, if two variables are independent or conditionally independent given a third variablein one model, then this same relation of independence (or conditional independence) must be captured in any theory of that model. A theory can add conditional independencies not present in the higher-level model. For instance, a mediation theory, \\(X \\rightarrow M \\rightarrow Y\\), implies a conditional independence that is not present in the higher-level, \\(X \\rightarrow Y\\) model that it supports: in the lower-level model only, \\(X\\) is conditionally independent of \\(Y\\) given \\(M\\). But we may not theorize aways (conditional) independencies insisted on by our higher-level claim. Return to models \\(M\\) and \\(M&#39;\\) in Figure 6.1(a). Importantly, in moving from the higher- to the lower-level model, we have effectively split the nodal-type term \\(\\theta^Y\\) into two parts: \\(\\theta^{Y_\\text{lower}}\\) and \\(\\theta^K\\). Intuitively, in the higher-level model, (a), \\(Y\\) is a function of \\(X\\) and \\(\\theta^Y\\), the latter representing all things other than \\(X\\) than can affect \\(Y\\). Or, in the language of our nodal-type setup, \\(\\theta^Y\\) represents all of the (unspecified) sources of variation in \\(X\\)s effect on \\(Y\\). When we insert \\(K\\) into the model, however, \\(X\\) now does not directly affect \\(Y\\) but only does so via \\(K\\). Further, we model \\(X\\) as acting on \\(K\\) in a manner conditioned by \\(\\theta^K\\), which represents all of the (unspecified) factors determining \\(X\\)s effect on \\(K\\). The key thing to notice here is that \\(\\theta^K\\) now represents a portion of the variance that \\(\\theta^Y\\) represented in the higher-level graph: some of the variation in \\(X\\)s effect on \\(Y\\) now arises from variation in \\(X\\)s effect on \\(K\\), which is captured by \\(\\theta^K\\). So, for instance, \\(X\\) might have no effect on \\(Y\\) because \\(\\theta^K\\) takes on the value \\(\\theta^K_{00}\\), so that \\(X\\) has no effect on \\(K\\). Put differently, any effect of \\(X\\) on \\(Y\\) must arise from an effect of \\(X\\) on \\(K\\); so \\(\\theta^K\\)s value must be either \\(\\theta^K_{01}\\) or \\(\\theta^K_{10}\\) for \\(X\\) to affect \\(Y\\).5 What \\(\\theta^K\\) represents, then, is that part of the original \\(\\theta^Y\\) that arose from some force other than \\(X\\) operating at the first step of the causal chain from \\(X\\) to \\(Y\\). So now, \\(\\theta^Y\\) in the lower-level graph is not quite the same entity as it was in the higher-level graph. In the original graph, \\(\\theta^Y\\) represented all sources of variation in \\(X\\)s effect on \\(Y\\). In the lower-level model, with \\(K\\) as mediator, \\(\\theta^Y\\) represents only the variation in \\(K\\)s effect on \\(Y\\). Put differently, \\(\\theta^Y\\) has been expunged of any factors shaping the first stage of the causal process, which now reside in \\(\\theta^K\\). We highlight this change in \\(\\theta^Y\\)s meaning by referring in the second model to \\(\\theta^{Y_\\text{lower}}\\). Consider next model \\(M^{\\prime\\prime}\\) panel (c) in Figure 6.1, which also supports (implies) the higher-level model in panel \\((a)\\). The logical relationship between models \\((a)\\) and \\((c)\\), however, is somewhat different. Here the lower-level model specifies one of the conditions that comprised \\(\\theta^Y\\) in the higher-level model. In specifying a moderator, \\(C\\), we have extracted \\(C\\) from \\(\\theta^Y\\), leaving \\(\\theta^{Y_\\text{lower}}\\) to represent all factors other than \\(C\\) that condition \\(Y\\)s response to its parents. More precisely, \\(\\theta^{Y_\\text{lower}}\\) now represents the set of nodal types defining how \\(Y\\) responds jointly to \\(X\\) and \\(C\\). Again, the relabeling as \\(\\theta^{Y_\\text{lower}}\\) reflects this change in the terms meaning. Whereas in Model \\(M^{\\prime}\\) we have extracted \\(\\theta^K\\) from \\(\\theta^Y\\), in Model \\(M^{\\prime\\prime}\\), it is \\(C\\) itself that we have extracted from \\(\\theta^Y\\), substantively specifying what had been just a random disturbance. &gt; 6.2.2 Gains from theory We begin with theory \\(M_1\\) which together with data \\(D\\) implies claim \\(M_2\\). We then posit theory \\(M_0\\) of \\(M_1\\)and so \\(M_0\\) implies \\(M_1\\), but \\(M_0\\), coupled with \\(D\\), produces a claim , \\(M_2&#39;\\), that is differentand hopefully betterthan \\(M_2&#39;\\). We illustrate using a theory that allows use of the front door criterion. Imagine we have data on three variables, \\(X\\), \\(Y\\), and \\(M\\). We begin, however, with a model \\(M_1\\): \\(A \\rightarrow X \\rightarrow Y \\leftarrow A\\), that includes nodes for two of the three variables, \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), but not \\(M\\), as well as a node \\(A\\) for which we do not have data. We see a strong correlation between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) and infer \\(M_2\\): that \\(X\\) is a likely cause \\(Y\\). Our inference under \\(M_2\\) is uncertaing because we are aware that the correlation may be due to the confound \\(C\\). We posit theory \\(M_0\\) \\(A \\rightarrow X \\rightarrow M \\rightarrow Y \\leftarrow A\\). This theory now lets us make better use of data \\(M\\). If we observe for instance that \\(X\\) and \\(M\\) are uncorrelated, then we infer with confidence that in fact \\(X\\) did not cause \\(Y\\), despite the correlation. Thus, in return for specifying a theory for \\(M_1\\), we have been able to make better use of data and form a more confident conclusion. Critically the theory does not alter priors over our query. Our prior over the effect of \\(X\\) on \\(Y\\) may be identical under \\(M_1\\) and \\(M_0\\), but our conclusions, given data, differ. This one reason to theorize our models  develop more elaborate, lower-level models to support them  is to be able to reap greater inferential leverage from the more elaborate theory. But how much more? For instance, what are the gains from a theory that introduces a node \\(K\\) relative to one that does not include \\(K\\)? What is the value-added of the more elaborate theory? One approach to assessing the contribution of a theory is to calculate the mean reduction in Bayes risk. Suppose we start with a baseline model with variables in the set \\(\\mathcal W\\) and want to answer a query, \\(Q\\). We can then define the gains from theory as: \\[\\text{Gains from theory} = 1- \\frac{E_{K|\\mathcal W}(Var(Q|K,\\mathcal W))}{Var(Q|\\mathcal W)}\\] &gt; We can think of the Bayes risk as the inverse of an \\(R^2\\) measure in a regression framework (see also Gelman and Pardoe (2006)): it is the variance in our query given what we have observed. Here we are defining the gains from theory as the degree to which we have reduced that variance by observing \\(K\\) and \\(\\mathcal W\\), relative to just observing \\(\\mathcal W\\). Another approach is to ask: how much better are our guesses having observed \\(K\\) compared to what we would have guessed before, given what we know having observed \\(K\\)? &gt; \\[Wisdom = \\int(q_0 - q)^2 - (q_k - q)^2 p(q | k)dq\\] This captures how much better off we are with the guess we have made given current data (\\(q_k\\)) compared to the guess we would have made if we had a theory that did not let us make use of it (\\(q_0\\)), knowing what we know having observe \\(K\\) (\\(p(q|k)\\). A modest advantage of this conceptualization is that we can still record gains in learning even if the learning operates such that the posterior variance is larger than the prior variance. Even so, the implications for strategy are the same since wisdom is maximized by a strategy that reduces expected squared error. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 6.2.3 Mappings are not 1 to 1 The mappings between higher-level claims and theories may not be one-to-one. A single theory can support multiple higher-level models. Moreover, a single higher-level relation can be supported by multiple, possibly incompatible lower-level theories. To illustrate, consider two lower level theories of democratization: (\\(L_1\\)): \\(Inequality \\rightarrow Democratization \\leftarrow Mobilization\\) (\\(L_2\\)): \\(Inequality \\rightarrow Mobilization \\rightarrow Democratization\\) Note how these theories are incompatible with one another. While \\(Inequality\\) and \\(Democratization\\) are independent in \\(L_1\\), they are causally related in \\(L_2\\). Moreover, in \\(L_2\\), \\(Inequality\\) and \\(Democratization\\) are related only through \\(Mobilization\\), while in \\(L_1\\), \\(Democratization\\) is directly affected by \\(Inequality\\).6 Now, consider the following three higher-level claims: (\\(H_1\\)): \\(Inequality \\rightarrow Mobilization\\) (\\(H_2\\)): \\(Inequality \\rightarrow Democratization\\) (\\(H_3\\)): \\(Mobilization \\rightarrow Democratization\\) \\(H_1\\) can be supported only by one of these theories: only in \\(L_2\\), and not in \\(L_1\\), does \\(Inequality\\) cause \\(Mobilization\\).7 However, our other two hypotheses could each rest on both of the lower-level theories, even though those two theories are incompatible with one another. \\(H_1\\) could be derived from (explained by) either theory: though the two theories differ on whether mobilization is a mediator or a moderator, they agree that inequality can affect democratization. Similarly, both theories imply \\(H_2\\), in which \\(Mobilization\\) affects \\(Democratization\\), even though the two theories disagree on whether inequality is an antecedent to mobilization or a moderator of its effect. Thus, multiple theories can usually be proposed to explain any given causal effect, and those theories need not be consistent with each other. When seeking an explanation for, say, \\(H_1\\), the choice between \\(L_1\\) and \\(L_2\\) cannot be dictated by logical mappings between models; it must be drawn from a substantive belief about which set of causal dependencies operates in the world. On the other hand, \\(L_2\\) is logically ruled out as an explanation of \\(H_3\\). It is also true that any given theory logically implies multiple higher-level claims about causal relations. \\(L_2\\) implies both \\(H_2\\) and \\(H_3\\). Note, however, that the multiple higher-level claims that follow from a theory must be compatible with one another. 6.3 Consistency If a lower level model is invoked to justify a higher level model then the relations implied by the lower level models must obtain in the lower level model. The lower level model must be consistent with the higher level model an vice versa. This consistency requirement relates both to structural and probabilistic relations. For instance, suppose we start with an \\(I \\rightarrow D\\) model and the belief that \\(Pr(\\theta^D=\\theta^D_{01}) = 0.5\\)  i.e., effects are positive \\(50\\%\\) of the time. On a structural level, as we have seen, this model could be supported by the model \\(I \\rightarrow M \\rightarrow D\\). But what beliefs about causal effects in this lower-level model might support the belief that effects of \\(I\\) on \\(D\\) are positive \\(50\\%\\) of the time? As with structural mappings, we can imagine a whole range of probabilistic beliefs at the lower level that would be consistent with a given higher-level belief. In a \\(I \\rightarrow M \\rightarrow D\\) model, we can arrive at a positive effect of \\(I\\) on \\(D\\) either through a combination of the nodal types \\(\\theta_{01}^M\\) and \\(\\theta_{01}^{D_{\\text lower}}\\) (linked positive effects) or of the nodal types \\(\\theta_{10}^M\\) and \\(\\theta_{10}^{D_{\\text lower}}\\) (linked negative effects). So, for instance, a lower-level model in which \\(Pr(\\theta^M=\\theta_{01}^M)=0.5\\), \\(Pr(\\theta^{D_{\\text lower}}=\\theta_{01}^{D_{\\text lower}})=0.5\\), \\(Pr(\\theta^M=\\theta_{10}^M)=0.5\\), and \\(Pr(\\theta^{D_{\\text lower}}=\\theta_{10}^{D_{\\text lower}})=0.5\\) would be consistent with the belief that \\(Pr(\\theta^D=\\theta^D_{01}) = 0.5\\). So too, however, would a lower-level model in which \\(Pr(\\theta^M=\\theta_{01}^M)=0.707\\), \\(Pr(\\theta^{D_{\\text lower}}=\\theta_{01}^{D_{\\text lower}})=0.707\\), \\(Pr(\\theta^M=\\theta_{10}^M)=0\\), and \\(Pr(\\theta^{D_{\\text lower}}=\\theta_{10}^{D_{\\text lower}})=0\\) equally implies \\(Pr(\\theta^D=\\theta^D_{01}) = 0.5\\) in the higher-level model. Meanwhile, there is a whole range of beliefs about effects in the lower-level model that do not justify the higher-level belief. For instance, any lower-level model in which \\((Pr(\\theta^D=\\theta^D_{00}) + Pr(\\theta^D=\\theta^D_{11})) &gt; 0.5\\) is inconsistent with the belief in a 0.5 probability of positive \\(I \\rightarrow D\\) effects and cannot serve as a theory of the higher-level model. We will generally want to think of lower-level models with quite different distributional beliefs as representing different theories, as they will typically capture quite different substantive beliefs about how the world works. We can think of the first lower-level model, above, as one in which inequality can cause democratization via two mechanisms, either by causing mass-mobilization which causes democratizaiton or by preventing mass-mobilization which prevents democratization  while the second model is a theory in which only the former mechanism operates. 6.4 Application: Formal theories and causal models In social sciences there sometimes seems to be a sharp divide between formalanalytictheories and empirical claims. Consider for instance the claim that the number of Nash equilibria is generically odd in finite games is often understood to be a theoretical claim. Unless there are errors in the derivation of the result, the claim is true in the sense that the conclusions follow from the assumptions. There is no evidence that we could go looking for in the world to assess the claim. The same can be said of the theoretical claims of many formal models in social sciences; they are theoretical deductions of the if-then variety (Clarke and Primo 2012). In the standard (hypothetico-deductive) model; a theory originates in the mind and then retained or rejected if it is consistent with data (Popper 2002). In practice, this usually requires a step in which the formal theory is translated either wholesale or piecemeal into a set of empirical statements which are put to the test. We seek to confirm theories by developing and testing hypotheses about the similarity of a model or theory to particular features of the world. In both cases, a theory is positedpossibly on the basis of logic or background knowledgeand then assessed. The value (truth or usefulness) of the model itself is the object of inquiry. (Clarke and Primo 2012) The causal modelling framework allows for a different approach to combining theory and data, in which theories are represented as causal models that capture the ideal operation of the theory as well as the conditions under which the claims of the theory are expected to hold. The causal model can naturally include uncertainty about any or all assumptions and claims of the theory, allowing for an updating of the theory along with data. These are what might be called, at the risk of provoking ire, empirical theories. Theory, in this sense, is a collection of claims with empirical content: a theory refers to a set of proposition of causal relations in the world that might or might not hold, and is susceptible to assessment against data. Though it is not standard practice, formal models produced by game theorists can often be represented using the notation of structural causal models. Moreoever, doing so may be fruitful. Consider for instance the class of normal form games studied by Nash. In the canonical set up, each player \\(i\\) can choose an action \\(\\sigma_i\\) from set \\(\\Sigma_i\\) and receives a payoff \\(u_i\\) that depends on the actions of all players. A particular game, \\(\\Gamma\\) is the collection of players, action sets, and payoffs. For two players, for instance, we might imagine a representation of a game as shown in Figure 6.3. Figure 6.3: Formal structure of a normal form game. Here the only functional equations are the utility functions, the utilities, given actions, are the implications of the theory, and so this is just a theory of how outcomes depend on social actions. It is not (yet) a behavioral theory. A behavioral theory might claim that in normal form games, players play Nash equilibrium. How might this be represented as a causal model? Figure 6.4 provides one representation. Figure 6.4: Formal structure of a normal form game. Here beliefs about the game form (\\(\\Gamma\\)) results in strategy choices by actors. If players play according to Nashs theory the functional equations for the strategy choices are given by the Nash equilibrium solution itself, with a refinement in case of multiplicity. This model represents what we expect to happen in a game under Nashs theory, but it does not provide much of an explanation. A lower level causal model might help. In Figure 6.5 the game form \\(\\Gamma\\) determines the beliefs about what actions the other player would make (thus \\(\\sigma_2^e\\) is 1s belief about 2s actions). The functional equations for \\(\\sigma_2^e\\) and \\(\\sigma_1^e\\) might, for instance, be the Nash equilibrium solution itself: that is, players expect other players to play according to the Nash equilibrium (or in the case of multiple, a particular equilibrium selected using some refinement). The beliefs in turn, together with the game form (which contains \\(u1, u_2\\)), are what cause the players to select a particular action. The functional equation for \\(\\sigma_1\\) might thus be \\(\\sigma_1 = \\arg \\max_\\sigma u_1(\\sigma, \\sigma_2^e)\\). Figure 6.5: Formal structure of a normal form game. This representation implies a set of relations that can be compared against empirical patterns. Do players indeed hold these beliefs when playing a given game? are actions indeed consistent with beliefs in ways specified by the theory. It provides a theory of beliefs and a theory of individual behavior as well as an explanation for social outcomes. The model in Figure 6.5 provides a foundation of sorts for Nashs theory. It suggests that players play Nash equilibria because they expect others to and they are utility maximizers. But this is not the only explanation that can be provided; alternatively behavior might line up with the theory without passing through beliefs at all as suggested in some accounts from evolutionary game theory that show how processes might select for behavior that corresponds to Nash even if agents are unaware of the game they are playing. One might step still further back and ask why would actors form these beliefs, or take these actions, and answer in terms of assumptions about actor rationality. Figure 6.6 for instance is a model in which actor rationality might vary and might influence beliefs about the actions of others as well as reactions to those beliefs. Fully specified functional equations might specify not only how actors act when rational but also how they react when they are not. In this sense the model in Figure 6.6 both nests Nashs theory and provides an explanation for why actors conform to the predictions of the theory. Figure 6.6: Formal structure of a normal form game. In a final elaboration we can represent a kind of underspecification of Nashs theory that make it difficult to take the theory to data. In the above we assumption that players chose actions based on expectations that the other player would play the Nash equilibriumor that the theory would specificy which equilibrium in the case of multiplicity. But it is well known that Nashs theory often does not provide a unique solution. This indeterminacy can be captured in the Causal model as shown in Figure 6.7 where a common shocklabelled \\(\\nu\\), and intepreted as normsinteracts with the game form to determine the expectations of other players. The functional equation for expectations can then allow for the possibility that (i) there is a unique equilibrium invariably chosen and played by both (ii) or a guarantee that players are playing one or other equilibrium together but uncertainty over which one is played, or (iii) the possibility that players are in fact out of sync, with each playing optimal strategies given beliefs but nevertheless not playing the ssame equilbria. Nashs theory likely corresponds to position (ii). It can be captured by functional equations on beliefs given \\(\\nu\\) but the theory does not specify \\(\\nu\\), in the same way that it does not specify \\(\\Gamma\\). Figure 6.7: A normal form game with a representation of equilibrium selection norms. We highlight three points from this discussion. First the discussion highlights that thinking of theory as causal models does not force a move away from abstract analytic theories; these can often be incorporated in the same framework. This is true even for equilibrium analysis that seems to involve a kind of simultaneity on first blush. Second, the discussion highlights how the causal modelling framework can make demands for specificity from formal theories. For instance specifying a functional relations from game form to actions requires a specification of a selection criterion in the event of multiple equilibria. Including agent rationality as a justification for the theory invites a specification for what would happen absent rationality. Third the example shows a way of building a bridge from pure theory to empirical claims. One can think of Nashs theory as an entirely data free set of claims. When interpreted however as a proposition about the ways players might behave, represented as a causal model, we are on a path to being able to use data to refine the theory. Thus we might begin with a formal specification like that in Figure 6.7 but with initial uncertainty about player rationality, optimizing behavior, and equilibrium selection. This theory nests Nash but does not presume the theory to be a valid description of processes in the world. Combined with data, however, we shift to a more refined theory that selects Nash from the lower level model. 6.5 Conclusion We see three gains from this conceptualization of theory. First it helps clarify what is required for theoretical justification of a model. Second it clarifies what is meant by explanation. Third it provides one framework to answer the question: when is a theory useful? Our approach also shares with Clarke and Primo the idea that models are not full and faithful reflections of reality; they are maps designed for a particular purpose. In the case of causal models, the purpose is to capture relationships of independence and possible causal dependence. As we have shown, that is a purpose that allows for the stripping away of detailthough it also forbids certain simplifications (such as any simplification that removes a dependency between variables).
