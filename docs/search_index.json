But deep down we know that all of these models are wrong, in myriad ways. We examine strategies for figuring out whether a model is likely doing more harm than good. Throughout this book we have maintained the conceit that you believe your model. But it is also obvious that even the most non-parametric-seeming models depend on substantive assumptions and that these may be wrong. More generally there is a literature on probabilistic causal models that assess the scope for inferences when researchers provide ranges of plausible values for parameters (perhaps intervals, perhaps only signs, positive negative, zero), rather than specifying a probability distribution. For a comprehensive treatment of qualitative algebras, see Parsons (2001). Under this kind of approach a researcher might willing to say that they think some probability \\(p\\) is not plausibly greater than .5, but unwilling to make a statement about their beliefs about where in the \\(0\\) to \\(0.5\\) range it lies. Such incomplete statements can be enough to rule our classes of conclusion. 15.1 Tools for evaluating models 15.1.1 Check conditional independencies Claims of conditional independence - Show for whether there’s a direct effect of X on Y reference_model &lt;- make_model(&quot;X -&gt; M -&gt; Y &lt;- X&quot;) %&gt;% set_parameters(c(.5, .5, .1, .1, .7, .1, rep(.05, 8), .25, rep(.05, 7))) analyst_model &lt;- make_model(&quot;X -&gt; M -&gt; Y&quot;) data &lt;- simulate_data(reference_model, using = &quot;parameters&quot;, n = 1000) # summary(lm(Y~X*M, data = data)) 15.1.2 Check confounding assumptions approach 2 – say actual confound is q~=0; but model assumes q = 0. Draw data from priors, draw data; given data type (001, 100 etc) plot (a) the posterior distribution under no confounding nad (b) the distribution of estimands that gave rise to the data. 15.1.3 Check prior dependence A graph showing how some conclusions changes as we relax one of the restrictions. How much do our conclusions depend on qual restrictions? How do conclusions differ if we drop all restrictions 15.1.4 Check fit Approaches using simulated data from the posterior predictive distribution are described in Gabry et al. (2019) The graphs below compare (using tools in the bayesplot) package, show how typical the data we observe is for the model that correctly assumes a direct effect and the model that incorrectly excludes it. ## Warning: package &#39;bayesplot&#39; was built under R version 3.6.1 ## This is bayesplot version 1.7.0 ## - Online documentation and vignettes at mc-stan.org/bayesplot ## - bayesplot theme set to bayesplot::theme_default() ## * Does _not_ affect other ggplot2 plots ## * See ?bayesplot_theme_set for details on theme setting ## Warning: package &#39;rstanarm&#39; was built under R version 3.6.1 ## Registered S3 method overwritten by &#39;xts&#39;: ## method from ## as.zoo.xts zoo ## rstanarm (Version 2.18.2, packaged: 2018-11-08 22:19:38 UTC) ## - Do not expect the default priors to remain the same in future rstanarm versions. ## Thus, R scripts should specify priors explicitly, even if they are just the defaults. ## - For execution on a local, multicore CPU with excess RAM we recommend calling ## options(mc.cores = parallel::detectCores()) ## - Plotting theme set to bayesplot::theme_default(). ## ## Attaching package: &#39;rstanarm&#39; ## The following object is masked from &#39;package:rstan&#39;: ## ## loo ## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`.

Compare out of sample fit between model with posteriors and priors. Reality checks – posterior fits. Predict data from the posterior. Look at whether the data you see are similar to the data you actually have. 15.1.5 Assess likelihoods under different models Compare likelihoods of the data under different models 15.2 Evaluating the Democracy-Inequality model 15.2.1 Prior check In a second iteration of the analysis, we show what happens if we loosen the monotonicity restriction on \\(I\\)’s effect on \\(M\\). Here we consider negative effects of \\(I\\) on \\(M\\) unlikely, rather than impossible, and we consider null and positive effects somewhat likely. We refer to these priors as “quantitative priors” in the sense that they place a numerical value on beliefs rather than a logical restriction. Here, we set our prior on \\(\\theta^M\\) as: \\(p(\\theta^M=\\theta^M_{10})=0.1\\), \\(p(\\theta^M=\\theta^M_{00})=0.25\\), \\(p(\\theta^M=\\theta^M_{11})=0.25\\), and \\(p(\\theta^M=\\theta^M_{01})=0.4\\). We show the results for the inferences given different findings in tables and . The mapping into expected posterior variance associated with each strategy is shown by the numbers in parentheses in Table . The results differ in various modest ways. However, the biggest difference we observe is in the degree to which the mobilization clue matters when we are looking for negative effects of inequality. As discussed, if we assumed monotonic positive effects of inequality on mobilization and monotonic positive effects of mobilization on inequality, then the mediator clue is uninformative about the indirect pathway since that pathway can only generate a positive effect. However, if we allow for the possibility of a negative effect of inequality on mobilization, we now make \\(M\\) informative as a mediator even when the effect of inequality that we are interested in is negative: it is now possible that inequality has a negative effect on democratization via a negative effect on mobilization, followed by a positive effect of mobilization on democratization. So now, observing whether mobilization occurred adds information about whether a negative effect could have occurred via the mobilization pathway. Moreover, it is possible for the two effects of observing \\(M\\) on our beliefs to work in opposite ways. What we learn from observing \\(M\\) about the \\(I \\rightarrow M \\rightarrow D\\) pathway may push in a different direction from what we learn from observing \\(M\\) about the direct \\(I \\rightarrow D\\) pathway. We see this dynamic at work in a case with low inequality and democratization. Where we are only learning about \\(M\\) as a moderator of \\(I\\)’s direct effect (monotonicity assumption in place), observing \\(M=0\\) shifts our beliefs in favor of \\(I\\)’s negative effect. But where we are learning about \\(M\\) as both mediator and moderator, observing \\(M=0\\) shifts our beliefs against \\(I\\)’s negative effect. The reason for this latter result is straightforward: if \\(I=0\\) and we then see \\(M=0\\), then we have just learned that inequality’s possible indirect negative effect, running via the mobilization pathway, has not in fact occurred; and this has a considerable downward effect on our beliefs in an overall negative effect of inequality. This learning outweighs the small positive impact of observing \\(M=0\\) on our confidence that \\(I\\) had a direct negative effect on \\(D\\). We see these differences most clearly in the cases of Albania (as compared to Mexico) and Nicaragua (as compared to Taiwan). Under priors fully constrained to monotonic causal effects, we saw that the mediator clue, \\(M\\), made only a small difference to our inferences. However, if we allow for a negative effect of \\(I\\) on \\(M\\), even while believing it to be unlikely, observing mobilization in Albania and Nicaragua makes us substantially more confident that inequality mattered, and differentiates our conclusions about these cases more sharply from our conclusions about Mexico and Taiwan, respectively. 15.2.2 Monotonic restrictions Compare fit between model with and without monotonic restrictions References "]
