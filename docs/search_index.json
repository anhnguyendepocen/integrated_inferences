Lower-level models serve as a theory for a higher level model if the higher level model can be deduced from the lower level model. The empirical content of a lower level model is the possible reduction in variance of the higher level model that it can provide. In Chapter 3, we worked with a set of theories. But what exactly do we mean by a theorythe term is used in very different ways in different social scientific contextsand how does theory map onto a causal-model framework? In this book, we will refer to a theory is an explanation of a phenomeon: a theory provides an account of how or under what conditions a set of causal relationships operate. Moreover, we can express both a theory and the claims being theorized as causal models. A theory, then, is a model that explains and implies another modelpossibly with the help of some data. First, we elaborate upon our working definition of theory, showing how it operates within a conception of models in levels. This requires thinking through how a more detailed, lower-level causal structure can imply, and thus explain, a less-detailed higher-level structure. We also work through how the nodal and causal types in a more detailed model, and beliefs about those types, map onto types (and beliefs about types) in a simpler model. And we a logic for moving between levels of detail: what kinds of elaborations of a simple model are possible, and what kinds of simplifications of complex models are permissible? We then turn to the relationship between theory and evidence in a causal-model framework, as compared to the way that relationship operates in a more conventional theory-testing approach. Put simply, when we work with causal models, we do not subject our theories to up-or-down empirical tests against data; rather, we allow the data to shift our beliefs across causal possibilities within a multi-dimensional theoretical space. In embedding theorization within the world of causal models, we ultimately have an empirical objective in mind. Theorizing a causal relationship of interest, in our framework, means elaborating our causal beliefs about the world in greater detail. As we show in later chapters, theorizing in the form of a causal model allows us to generate research designs: to identify sources of inferential leverage and to explicitly and systematically link observations of components of a causal system to the causal questions we seek to answer. We discuss toward the end of the chapter how this definition of theory relates to common understandings of theory in the social sciences. 4.1 Theory as a lower-level model Let us say that a causal model, \\(M^\\prime\\), is a theory of \\(M\\) if \\(M\\) is implied by \\(M^\\prime\\). Theory is, thus, all relative. \\(M^\\prime\\) might itself sit atop a theory, \\(M^{\\prime\\prime}\\), that implies \\(M^\\prime\\). To help fix the idea of theory as supporting or underlying the model(s) it theorizes, we refer to the theory, \\(M^\\prime\\), as a lower-level model relative to \\(M\\) and refer to \\(M\\) as a higher-level model relative to its theorization, \\(M^\\prime\\).1 We illustrate showing two models, \\(M^\\prime\\) and \\(M^{\\prime\\prime}\\), that each imply a model \\(M\\). In each case the lower level models contain additional nodes in a way that allows for a kind of disaggregation of exogenous nodes. Figure 4.1: Here we represent the simple claim that one variable causes another, and two theories  lower-level models  that could explain this claim. Both model (b) and model (c) involve theorization via disaggregation of nodes. We start with the higher-level model, \\(M\\), represented in Figure 4.1(a). We can then offer the model, \\(M^\\prime\\), in panel (b) as a theory, or lower-level model, of \\(M\\). We have added a node, \\(K\\), in the causal chain between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\). We can say that \\(M^\\prime\\) is a theory of \\(M\\) because the causal structure in \\(M^\\prime\\) implies the causal structure in \\(M\\): if \\(X\\) affects \\(Y\\) through \\(K\\), then \\(X\\) affects \\(Y\\). To put the point more intuitively, and closer in spirit to how social scientists commonly think about theory, we can think of \\(M^\\prime\\) as an explanation of \\(M\\). If we ask, why does \\(X\\) affect \\(Y\\)? \\(M^\\prime\\) provides an answer: \\(X\\) affects \\(Y\\) because \\(X\\) affects \\(K\\), and \\(K\\) affects \\(Y\\). Importantly, in moving from the higher- to the lower-level model, we have effectively split the nodal-type term \\(\\theta^Y\\) into two parts: \\(\\theta^{Y_\\text{lower}}\\) and \\(\\theta^K\\). Intuitively, in the higher-level model, (a), \\(Y\\) is a function of \\(X\\) and \\(\\theta^Y\\), the latter representing all things other than \\(X\\) than can affect \\(Y\\). Or, in the language of our nodal-type setup, \\(\\theta^Y\\) represents all of the (unspecified) sources of variation in \\(X\\)s effect on \\(Y\\). When we insert \\(K\\) into the model, however, \\(X\\) now does not directly affect \\(Y\\) but only does so via \\(K\\). Further, we model \\(X\\) as acting on \\(K\\) in a manner conditioned by \\(\\theta^K\\), which represents all of the (unspecified) factors determining \\(X\\)s effect on \\(K\\). The key thing to notice here is that \\(\\theta^K\\) now represents a portion of the variance that \\(\\theta^Y\\) represented in the higher-level graph: some of the variation in \\(X\\)s effect on \\(Y\\) now arises from variation in \\(X\\)s effect on \\(K\\), which is captured by \\(\\theta^K\\). So, for instance, \\(X\\) might have no effect on \\(Y\\) because \\(\\theta^K\\) takes on the value \\(\\theta^K_{00}\\), so that \\(X\\) has no effect on \\(K\\). Put differently, any effect of \\(X\\) on \\(Y\\) must arise from an effect of \\(X\\) on \\(K\\); so \\(\\theta^K\\)s value must be either \\(\\theta^K_{01}\\) or \\(\\theta^K_{10}\\) for \\(X\\) to affect \\(Y\\).2 What \\(\\theta^K\\) represents, then, is that part of the original \\(\\theta^Y\\) that arose from some force other than \\(X\\) operating at the first step of the causal chain from \\(X\\) to \\(Y\\). So now, \\(\\theta^Y\\) in the lower-level graph is not quite the same entity as it was in the higher-level graph. In the original graph, \\(\\theta^Y\\) represented all sources of variation in \\(X\\)s effect on \\(Y\\). In the lower-level model, with \\(K\\) as mediator, \\(\\theta^Y\\) represents only the variation in \\(K\\)s effect on \\(Y\\). Put differently, \\(\\theta^Y\\) has been expunged of any factors shaping the first stage of the causal process, which now reside in \\(\\theta^K\\). We highlight this change in \\(\\theta^Y\\)s meaning by referring in the second model to \\(\\theta^{Y_\\text{lower}}\\). Theorization here thus starts with the proliferation of substantive variablesadding beliefs about intervening steps in a causal process. But, critically, it also involves an accompanying disaggregation of unexplained variation. Addition and splitting thus go hand-in-hand: the insertion of a mediator between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) also involves the splitting of \\(Y\\)s type node (\\(\\theta_Y\\)). Consider next model \\(M^{\\prime\\prime}\\) panel (c) in Figure 4.1, which also supports (implies) the higher-level model in panel \\((a)\\). The logical relationship between models \\((a)\\) and \\((c)\\), however, is somewhat different. Here the lower-level model specifies one of the conditions that comprised \\(\\theta^Y\\) in the higher-level model. In specifying a moderator, \\(C\\), we have extracted \\(C\\) from \\(\\theta^Y\\), leaving \\(\\theta^{Y_\\text{lower}}\\) to represent all factors other than \\(C\\) that condition \\(Y\\)s response to its parents. More precisely, \\(\\theta^{Y_\\text{lower}}\\) now represents the set of nodal types defining how \\(Y\\) responds jointly to \\(X\\) and \\(C\\). Again, the relabeling as \\(\\theta^{Y_\\text{lower}}\\) reflects this change in the terms meaning. Whereas in Model \\(M^{\\prime}\\) we have extracted \\(\\theta^K\\) from \\(\\theta^Y\\), in Model \\(M^{\\prime\\prime}\\), it is \\(C\\) itself that we have extracted from \\(\\theta^Y\\), substantively specifying what had been just a random disturbance. Since lower-level models imply higher level models, we think of theories as implying the models they are theorizing. If we believe Model \\(M&#39;\\), then we also must believe Model \\(M\\). If it is possible that \\(X\\) can affect \\(K\\) and possible that \\(K\\) can affect \\(Y\\), then it is possible that \\(X\\) can affect \\(Y\\). Similarly, if you believe Model \\(M^{\\prime\\prime}\\), then you must also believe Model \\(M\\): if it is true that \\(X\\) can affect \\(Y\\), possibly in ways that are moderated by \\(C\\), then it is trivially true that \\(X\\) can affect \\(Y\\). 4.1.1 Multiple justifications The mappings between higher-level claims and theories may not be one-to-one. A single theory can support multiple higher-level theories. Moreover, a single higher-level relation can be supported by multiple, possibly incompatible lower-level theories. To illustrate, consider two lower level theories of democratization: (\\(L_1\\)): \\(Inequality \\rightarrow Democratization \\leftarrow Mobilization\\) (\\(L_2\\)): \\(Inequality \\rightarrow Mobilization \\rightarrow Democratization\\) Note how these theories are incompatible with one another. While \\(Inequality\\) and \\(Democratization\\) are independent in \\(L_1\\), they are causally related in \\(L_2\\). Moreover, in \\(L_2\\), \\(Inequality\\) and \\(Democratization\\) are related only through \\(Mobilization\\), while in \\(L_1\\), \\(Democratization\\) is directly affected by \\(Inequality\\).3 Now, consider the following three higher-level claims: (\\(H_1\\)): \\(Inequality \\rightarrow Democratization\\) (\\(H_2\\)): \\(Mobilization \\rightarrow Democratization\\) (\\(H_3\\)): \\(Inequality \\rightarrow Mobilization\\) \\(H_1\\) could be derived from (explained by) either theory, \\(L_1\\) or \\(L_2\\). Although the two theories are incompatible with one another, in both theories \\(Inequality\\) affects \\(Democratization\\). Both theories likewise imply \\(H_2\\), in which \\(Mobilization\\) affects \\(Democratization\\). \\(H_3\\), however, can be supported only by one of these theories: only in \\(L_2\\), and not in \\(L_1\\), does \\(Inequality\\) cause \\(Mobilization\\).4 Thus multiple (possibly incompatible) theories can usually be proposed to explain any given causal effect. When seeking an explanation for, say, \\(H_1\\), the choice between \\(L_1\\) and \\(L_2\\) is not dictated by logic; it must be drawn from a substantive belief about which set of causal dependencies operates in the world. On the other hand, \\(L_2\\) is logically ruled out as an explanation of \\(H_3\\). Further, any given theory logically implies multiple (necessarily compatible) higher-level claims about causal relations. 4.2 Illustration of unpacking nodal types We now show more specifically how sets of nodal types in lower-level models map into nodal types in higher-level models. For concreteness, let us return to our democratization example and consider first the very basic claim that inequality can have an affect on democratization. We represent this simple claim in Figure 4.2, Panel (a). In this simple model, \\(I\\) may sometimes have an effect on \\(D\\) and sometimes not; and that effect may be positive or negative. All of this will depend on the cases nodal type on \\(D\\). Figure 4.2: DAG representations of three theories. DAGs only capture claims that one variable causes another, conditional on other variables. Theories (b) and (c) each imply theory (a). The figure also shows two models that each explain Model (a), though in different ways. Model (b) answers the explanatory question, How does inequality affect democratization? Model (c) answers the explanatory question, Why does inequalitys effect on democratization vary? or Under what conditions does \\(I\\) have a given effect on \\(D\\)? Both theories provide richer, more interpretable accounts of the phenomenon of interest than the simpler model that they are theorizing. These lower-level models imply a set of nodal types that are richer than that implied by (a). Recall that in Chapter 2, we considered the idea that at any node, a nodal type may be conceptualized as a case-specific disturbance that governs the mapping from input variables to outcome variables. The type node \\(\\theta^D\\) can take on the values \\(\\theta^D_{10}, \\theta^D_{01}, \\theta^D_{00}, \\theta^D_{11}\\), and this node can take on different values in different cases. However, differences in \\(\\theta^D\\)s value are left entirely unaccounted for. We are saying nothing about why inequality causes democratization in some places, prevents democratization in other places, and has no effect in still other places. 4.2.1 Type disaggregation in a mediation model Model (b) has nodal types defined for nodes \\(M\\) and for \\(D\\).5 We thus allow \\(I\\) to have a positive, negative, or no effect on \\(M\\), with \\(\\theta^M\\) taking on four possible values, \\(\\theta_{10}^M,\\theta_{01}^M,\\theta_{00}^M\\),and \\(\\theta_{11}^M\\). Further, we allow for \\(M\\) to have a positive, negative, or no effect on \\(D\\), with \\(\\theta^D_{\\text{lower}}\\)s possible values again being one of \\(\\theta_{10}^{D_{\\text lower}}\\), \\(\\theta_{01}^{D_{\\text lower}}\\), \\(\\theta_{00}^{D_{\\text lower}}\\), \\(\\theta_{11}^{D_{\\text lower}}\\). We can now think about combinations of nodal types in the lower-level model as mapping onto nodal types in the higher-level model. Table 4.1 illustrates. Table 4.1: Mapping from lower level nodal types on \\(M\\) and \\(D\\) to higher level causal types on \\(D\\). \\(\\theta_{10}^{D_{lower}}\\) \\(\\theta_{01}^{D_{lower}}\\) \\(\\theta_{00}^{D_{lower}}\\) \\(\\theta_{11}^{D_{lower}}\\) \\(\\theta_{10}^{M}\\) \\(\\theta_{01}^{D_{higher}}\\) \\(\\theta_{10}^{D_{higher}}\\) \\(\\theta_{00}^{D_{higher}}\\) \\(\\theta_{11}^{D_{higher}}\\) \\(\\theta_{01}^{M}\\) \\(\\theta_{10}^{D_{higher}}\\) \\(\\theta_{01}^{D_{higher}}\\) \\(\\theta_{00}^{D_{higher}}\\) \\(\\theta_{11}^{D_{higher}}\\) \\(\\theta_{00}^{M}\\) \\(\\theta_{11}^{D_{higher}}\\) \\(\\theta_{00}^{D_{higher}}\\) \\(\\theta_{00}^{D_{higher}}\\) \\(\\theta_{11}^{D_{higher}}\\) \\(\\theta_{11}^{M}\\) \\(\\theta_{00}^{D_{higher}}\\) \\(\\theta_{11}^{D_{higher}}\\) \\(\\theta_{00}^{D_{higher}}\\) \\(\\theta_{11}^{D_{higher}}\\) For instance, in a case in which both \\(\\theta^M=\\theta^M_{01}\\) (a positive effect of \\(I\\) on \\(M\\)) and \\(\\theta^{D_{\\text{lower}}}=\\theta_{01}^{D_{lower}}\\) (a positive effect of \\(M\\) on \\(D\\)), we have a positive effect of \\(I\\) on \\(D\\)meaning that, in the higher-level model, \\(\\theta^{D_{higher}}=\\theta^{D_{higher}}_{01}\\). Two linked negative effects at the lower level likewise generate a positive effect of \\(I\\) on \\(D\\)and so map onto the same higher-level nodal type, \\(\\theta^{D_{higher}}=\\theta^{D_{higher}}_{01}\\). Further, it is easy to see that if there is no causal effect at either the \\(I \\rightarrow M\\) step or the \\(M \\rightarrow D\\) step, we will have one of the null effect types at the higher level. This is because, in Model (b), \\(I\\) cannot affect \\(D\\) unless there are causal effects at both constituent steps. In other words, in Model (b), \\(I\\) can affect \\(D\\) only through \\(M\\) in this model; there are no direct effects or other pathways permitted. To foreshadow the discussion in later chapters, these mappings of nodal types between levels are critical. They allow us to draw inferences about causal relations at a lower level and use those inferences to answer questions posed at a higher level. For instance, if we can learn about the effect of inequality on mass mobilization (a question posed at the lower level), then we can apply that learning to answering a question about whether inequality affects democratization (a higher-level question). 4.2.2 Type disaggregation in a moderation model Alternatively, we might wonder why or under what conditions inequality causes democratization. Our simple claim, in panel (a), allows that \\(I\\) can cause \\(D\\), but provides no information about the conditions under which it does so. Those conditions are implicitly embedded within \\(\\theta^D\\), where they are left unspecified. We could, however, theorize some of what is left unsaid in in panel (a). We do this in panel (c), where we posit ethnic homogeneity (\\(E\\)) as a moderator of inequalitys effect on democratization. Panel (c) represents a theory of panel (a) in that it can help account for variation in causal effects that is unaccounted for by the model in (a). Model (c) has thus given substantive meaning to an aspect of the phenomenon that was merely residual variation in Model (a). Model (a) provides no account of why inequality has the effects it does, relying fully on \\(\\theta^D\\) as a placeholder for this uncertainty. In Model (c), \\(\\theta^D\\) plays a more modest role, with ethnic homogeneity doing a good deal of the work of determining inequalitys possible effects. In this graph, we again have a \\(\\theta_D^{\\text{lower}}\\) term, but it is a different object from \\(\\theta_D^{\\text{lower}}\\) in the mediation graph. In this moderation model, \\(\\theta_D^{\\text{lower}}\\) is more complex as it determines the mapping from two binary variables into \\(D\\). A causal type in this setup now represents how a case will respond to four different possible combinations of \\(I\\) and \\(E\\) values. Rather than four causal types, we now have 16, as there are 16 possible ways in which a case might respond to two binary variables (see Table ?? in Chapter 2). In Table 4.2 we give a mapping from a subset of these lower level types to the upper level types corresponding to the model in (a). Table 4.2: Values for \\(D\\) given \\(E\\) and \\(I\\). With two binary causal variables, there are 16 nodal types: 16 ways in which \\(Y\\) depends on \\(I\\) and \\(E\\). These lower level types map into higher level types for a model in which \\(Y\\) depends on \\(I\\) only, as shown in the final column. Low Type \\(I=0,E=0\\) \\(I=0,E=1\\) \\(I=1,E=0\\) \\(I=1, E=1\\) High Type \\(\\theta^{D}_{0000}\\) 0 0 0 0 \\(\\theta^{D}_{00}\\) \\(\\theta^{D}_{0001}\\) \\(\\theta^{D}_{0010}\\) 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 \\(\\theta^{D}_{01}\\) if \\(E=1\\), else \\(\\theta^D_{00}\\) \\(\\theta^D_{00}\\) if \\(E=1\\), else \\(\\theta^D_{01}\\) \\(\\theta^{D}_{0011}\\) 0 0 1 1 \\(\\theta^{D}_{01}\\) \\(\\vdots\\) \\(\\vdots\\) \\(\\vdots\\) \\(\\vdots\\) \\(\\vdots\\) \\(\\vdots\\) \\(\\theta^{D}_{1110}\\) 1 1 1 0 \\(\\theta^D_{11}\\) if \\(E=0\\), else \\(\\theta^D_{10}\\) \\(\\theta^{D}_{1111}\\) 1 1 1 1 \\(\\theta^D_{11}\\) Importantly we see that the mapping between lower- and higher-level types can depend on the value of the moderator. More generally, since we can think of the value of exogeneous nodes, \\(E\\) and \\(I\\), as being nodal types for those nodes, we can think of the lower level nodal type as a concatenation of the upper level nodal types for \\(E\\) and \\(D\\). Thus we can think of the the higher level type as depending uniquely on the fully specified lower level type. For instance, a case that has type \\(\\theta_{01}\\) in the higher-level model if it has type \\(\\theta_{0010}\\) in the lower-level model and \\(E=0\\). This is a case for which \\(I\\) has a positive effect on \\(D\\) when \\(E=0\\) and in which \\(E\\) is in fact 0. On the other hand, the same lower level type, in combination with \\(E=1\\) maps onto the type \\(\\theta_{10}\\) in the higher-level modela type in which \\(D\\) responds negatively to \\(I\\). In later chapters, we represent all lower- to higher-level mappings relevant to a question of interest with the use of type-reduction tables that allow one to readily see how inferences drawn at one level inform causal questions posed at another level. 4.2.3 Other elaborations 4.2.4 Moving down levels We have already discussed two possible forms of theorization  moves down a level: (i) disaggregating existing nodes, i.e., by introducing beliefs about mediation or moderation, or (ii) adding nodes representing variation in a feature of context that is implicitly held constant in the higher-level model. There are other possible ways of elaborating a model. For instance, we can add antecedent conditions: causes of nodes that were exogenous in the higher-level model. Likewise, we can add downstream effects: outcomes of nodes that were terminal in the higher-level model. Figure 4.3: A higher-level model and a lower-level model that is impermissible. The central principle governing allowable elaborations is that a lower-level model must not introduce dependencies between variables that were omitted in the higher-level model. We provide an example of a violation of this principle in Figure 4.3. We start with a higher-level model, in panel (a), in which inequality affects democratization through mobilization. We then elaborate the model in panel (b) by adding ethnic homogeneity as a moderator of mobilizations effect. However, because ethnic homogeneity is also modeled here as affecting inequality, we have now introduced a source of dependence between inequality and democratization that was omitted from the higher-level model. In panel (a), democratization and inequality were dependent only via mobilization; and so they are conditionally independent given mobilization. In panel (b), democratization and mobilization are additionally dependent via their common cause, ethnic homogeneity. By the rules governing causal graphs (see Chapter ), the higher-level specifically prohibited this second source of dependencysince all dependencies between variables must be represented. Put differently, if two variables are independent or conditionally independent given a third variablein one model, then this same relation of independence (or conditional independence) must be captured in any theory of that model. A theory can add conditional independencies not present in the higher-level model. For instance, a mediation theory, \\(X \\rightarrow M \\rightarrow Y\\), implies a conditional independence that is not present in the higher-level model that it supports, \\(X \\rightarrow Y\\): in the lower-level model only, \\(X\\) is conditionally independent of \\(Y\\) given \\(M\\). But we may not theorize away (conditional) independencies insisted on by our higher-level claim. TEXT We can also read Figure ?? as telling us the set of claims for which the lower-level graph in Figure can serve as a theory. As we can see, the range of claims that a moderately complex model can theorize is vast. For each simpler claim, moreover, there may be other possible lower-level graphstheories besides consistent with it. &gt; 4.2.5 Quantifying the gains of a theory What are the gains of a thoery that introduces a node \\(K\\) relative to one that does not include \\(K\\). What is the value added of the more elaborate theory? One approach to assessing the contribution of a theory is to calculate the mean reduction in Bayes risk: \\[\\text{Gains from theory} = 1- \\frac{E_{K|W}(Var(Q|K,W))}{Var(Q|W)}\\] This is a kind of \\(R^2\\) measure (see also Gelman and Pardoe (2006)). Another approach is to ask: how much better are my guesses now compared to what I would have guessed before, given what I know now. Expected wisdom. \\[Wisdom = \\int(q_0 - q)^2 - (q_k - q)^2 p(q | k)dq\\] This captures how much better off we are with the guess we have made given current data (\\(q_k\\)) compared to the guess we woudl have made without it (\\(q_0\\)), knowing what we know now (\\(p(q|k)\\). An advantage of this conceptualization is that you can record gains in learning even if posterior variance is larger than prior variance. Even still the implications for strategy are the same since wisdom is maximized by a strategy that reduces expected squared error. Other possible measures of gains from theory might include the simple correlation between \\(K\\) and \\(Q\\), or entropy-based measures (see Zhang and Srihari (2003) for many more possibilities). For this problem the correlation is given by (see appendix): \\[\\rho_{KQ} = \\frac{(\\phi_b+\\phi_d)(1-2p)(p(1-p))^{.5}}{ (p\\phi_b+(1-p)\\phi_d)(1-(p\\phi_b+(1-p)\\phi_d)))^{.5}}\\] One might also use a measure of mutual information from information theory: \\[I(Q,K) = \\sum_q \\sum_k P(q,k)\\log\\left(\\frac{P(q,k)}{P(q)P(k)}\\right)\\] To express this mutual information as a share of variation explained, we could divide \\(I(Q,K)\\) by the entropy of \\(Q\\), \\(H(Q)\\) where \\(H(Q) = -\\sum_qP(q)\\log(P(q))\\). The resulting ratio can be interpreted as 1 minus the ratio of the entropy of \\(Q\\) conditional (on \\(K\\)) to the unconditional entropy of \\(Q\\). For this example, Figure shows gains as a function of \\(\\phi_b\\) given a fixed value of \\(\\phi_d\\). The figure also shows other possible measures of probative value, with, in this case, the reduction in entropy tracking the reduced posterior variance closely. Figure 4.4: The solid line shows gains in precision (reduced posterior variance) for different values of \\(\\phi_b\\) given \\(\\phi_d=0.25\\) and \\(p=.5\\) for the example given in the text. Additional measures of probative value are also provided including \\(|\\phi_b - \\phi_d|\\), the correlation of \\(K\\) and \\(Q\\), and the reduction in entropy in \\(Q\\) due to mutual information in \\(Q\\) and \\(K\\). 4.3 Conclusion We close this chapter by considering how the understanding of theory that we work with in this book compares to other prominent understandings of theory. Theory as tautology. The claim that the number of Nash equilibria is generically odd in finite games is often understood to be a theoretical claim. Unless there are errors in the derivation of the result, the claim is true in the sense that the conclusions follow from the assumptions. There is no evidence that we could go looking for in the world to assess the claim. The same can be said of the theoretical claims of many formal models in social sciences; they are theoretical deductions of the if-then variety (Clarke and Primo 2012). Theory in this sense is true by tautology. By contrast, theory as we define it in this book refers to claims with empirical content: a theory refers to causal relations in the world that might or might not hold, and is susceptible to empirical testing. The deductive logical relations that hold in a causal model are those of conditional independence, as discussed in Chapter 2: for instance, if \\(X\\) causes \\(Y\\) only through \\(M\\) in a theory, then \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are conditionally independent given some value of \\(M\\). Theory as a collection of maps. According to Clarke and Primo (2012), building on a semantic view of theory (Giere (2010)), a theory is a collection of models, together with a set of hypotheses linking them to the real world. As in our usage, Clarke and Primo see theories and models as very similar objects: for them, a theory is a system of models; for us, a theory is a supporting model. In both frameworks, there is no real difference in kind between models and theories. Our approach also shares with Clarke and Primo the idea that models are not full and faithful reflections of reality; they are maps designed for a particular purpose. In the case of causal models, the purpose is to capture relationships of independence and possible causal dependence. As we have shown, that is a purpose that allows for the stripping away of detailthough it also forbids certain simplifications (such as any simplification that removes a dependency between variables). Clarke and Primo see models as useful to the extent that they are similar to features of the real world in ways related to the models purpose. Along these lines, a causal model will be useful to the extent that it posits relations of independence that are similar to those prevailing in the domain under investigation. Theory as a testable claim In the hypothetico-deductive framework, often traced back to Popper (2002) and highly influential in empirical political science, empirical social science is an activity of theory-testing. Having developed a theory, we then derive from it a set of empirical predictions and then test those predictions against evidence. In Clarke and Primo (2012), we also seek to confirm theories by developing and testing hypotheses about the similarity of a model or theory to particular features of the world. In both cases, a theory is positedpossibly on the basis of logic or background knowledgeand then assessed. The value (truth or usefulness) of the model itself is the object of inquiry. In a causal-model framework, theories are always tentative, and we can subject any model or theory to empirical evaluation, a task to which we turn in Chapter 16. However, in the books setup, theories are first and foremost expressions of what we already know and dont know about a given causal domain when inquiry begins. We encode this background knowledge in order to inform research-design choices and draw inferences from the data. Models and theories are thus, in this sense, the world within which inquiry unfolds. Indeed, as we explore in Chapter 5, the very questions we ask live withincan be represented as parts ofour theories. Theory as generalization In another of the many uses of theory, political scientists often think of theorization as generalization. For Van Evera (1997) and Przeworski and Teune (1970), for instance, theories are by their nature general statements that we can use to explain specific events. In this view, Diamond resources caused Sierra Leones civil war is a case-specific explanation; Natural resource endowments cause civil war is a theoretical formulation. In our treatment of theory as a lower-level causal model, however, there is no generic sense in which a theory is more or less general than the higher-level claim that it explains. In this books framework, we can theorize by generalizing: when we elaborate a model by building in variation in a factor that was held constant in the higher-level claim, we are making the model more general in scope. If our natural resources claim implicitly applies only to weak states, we can theorize this claim by allowing state strength to vary and articulating how the natural-resource effect hinges on that claim. However, when we theorize by disaggregating nodessay, by adding intervening causal stepswe have in fact made a more specific claim. Natural resources may cause civil war under a broad set of circumstances. Natural resources will cause civil war through looting by rebel groups under an almost certainly narrower set of circumstances. Here, the more elaborate argumentthe theorization of why \\(X\\) causes \\(Y\\)is actually a stronger claim, with narrower scope, than the simpler one that it supports. The value of parsimony Van Evera (1997) and Przeworski and Teune (1970) also express a common view in characterizing parsimony as a quality of good theory. While they recognize that parsimony must often be traded off against other goods, such as accuracy and generality, ceteris paribus a more parsimonious theoryone that uses fewer causal variables to explain variation in a given outcomeis commonly understood to be a better theory. We do not take issue with the idea that simpler models and explanations are, all else equal, better. But the succeeding chapters also demonstrate a distinctive and important way in which all else will often not be equal when we seek to use theory to guide research design and support causal inference. To foreshadow the argument to come, the elaboration of more detailed, lower-level models can direct us to new opportunities for learning. As we unpack a higher-level claim, we will often be identifying additional features of a phenomenon the observation of which can shed light on causal questions of interest. Moreover, our background beliefsthe prior knowledge on which causal inference must usually restare often more informative at lower levels than at higher levels: it will, for instance, often be easier for us express beliefs about causal effects for smaller steps along a causal chain than about an overarching \\(X \\rightarrow Y\\) effect. Making things more complicated, of course, still makes things more complicated. And we should avoid doing so when the payoff is small, as it will sometimes be. But in the pages to come, we will also see a distinct set of benefits that arise from drilling more deeply into our basis of prior knowledge when formulating inferential strategies. 4.4 Chapter Appendices 4.4.1 Summary Boxes BOX 1 Two kinds of theories. Theories are lower-level causal models that explain or provide an account of a higher-level, simpler model. There are two forms of theorization: The disaggregation of nodes. A single node in a higher-level model can be split into multiple nodes. For instance, for a higher-level model in which \\(X \\rightarrow Y \\leftarrow \\theta^Y\\): Mediation: A mediator, \\(M\\), can be introduced between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), thus splitting \\(\\theta^Y\\) into \\(\\theta^M\\) and \\(\\theta^{Y_\\text{lower}}\\). The mediation theory thus explains the \\(X \\rightarrow Y\\) relationship. Moderation: A component of \\(\\theta^Y\\) can be extracted and specified as a substantive variable. This variable is now a substantively conceptualized moderator of the \\(X \\rightarrow Y\\) relationship. The moderation theory thus provides a fuller explanation of why \\(X\\) has different effects on \\(Y\\) in different contexts. Generalization. A feature of context omitted and implicitly held constant in a higher-level model can be explicitly included in the model. The higher-level model is now explained as a special case of a more general set of causal relations. 4.4.2 Illustration of a Mapping from a Game to a DAG Our running example supports a set of higher level models, but it can also be implied by a lower level models. Here we illustrate with an example in which the lower level model is a game theoretic model, together with a solution.6 In Figure 4.5 we show a game in which nature first decides on the type of the media and the politician  is it a media that values reporting on corruption or not? Is the politician one who has a dominant strategy to engage in corruption or one who is sensitive to the risks of media exposure? In the example the payoffs to all players are fully specified, though for illustration we include parameter \\(b\\) in the voters payoffs which captures utility gains from sacking a politician that has had a negative story written about them whether or not they actually engaged in corruption. A somewhat less specific, though more easily defended, theory would not specify particular numbers as in the figure, but rather assume ranges on payoffs that have the same strategic implications. The theory is then the game plus a solution to the game. Here for a solution the theory specifies subgame perfect equilibrium. In the subgame perfect equilibrium of the game; marked out on the game tree (for the case \\(b=0\\)) the sensitive politicians do not engage in corruption when there is a free press  otherwise they do; a free press writes up any acts of corruption, voters throw out the politician if indeed she is corrupt and this corruption is reported by the press. As with any structural model, the theory says what will happen but also what would happen if things that should not happen indeed happened. Figure 4.5: A Game Tree. Solid lines represent choices on the (unique) equilibrium path of the subgames starting after natures move for the case in which \\(b=0\\). To draw this equilibrium as a DAG we include nodes for every action taken, nodes for features that determine the game being played, and the utilities at the end of the game. If equilibrium claims are justified by claims about the beliefs of actors then these could also appear as nodes. To be clear however these are not required to represent the game or the equilibrium, though they can capture assumed logics underlying the equilibrium choice. For instance a theorist might claim that humans are wired so that whenever they are playing a Stag Hunt game they play defect. The game and this solution can be represented on a DAG without reference to the beliefs of actors about the action of other players. However, if the justification for the equilibrium involves optimization given the beliefs of other players, a lower level DAG could represent this by having a node for the game description that points to beliefs about the actions of others, that then points to choices. In a game with dominant strategies, in contrast, there would be no arrows from these beliefs to actions. For our running example, nodes could usefully include the politicians expectations, since the governments actions depend on expectations of the actions of others. However, given the game there is no gain from including the medias expectations of the voters actions since in this case the medias actions do not depend on expectations of the voters actions then these expectations should be included. In Figure 4.6 we provide two examples of DAGs that illustrate lower level models that support our running example. The upper panel gives a DAG reflecting equilibrium play in the game described in Figure 4.5. Note that in this game there is an arrow between \\(C\\) and \\(Y\\) even though \\(Y\\) does not depend on \\(C\\) for some values of \\(b\\)this is because conditional independence requires that two variables are independent for all values of the conditioning set. For simplicity also we mark \\(S\\) and \\(X\\), along with \\(b\\) as features that affect which subgame is being playedtaking the subgames starting after Natures move. Note that the governments expectations of responses by others matters, but the expectations of other players do not matter given this game and solution. Note that the utilities appear twice in a sense. They appear in the subgame node, as they are part of the definition of the gamethough here they are the utilities that players expect at each terminal node; when they appear at the end of the DAG they are the utilities that actually arise (in theory at least). The lower level DAG is very low and much more general, representing the theory that in three player games of complete information, players engage in backwards induction and choose the actions that they expect to maximize utility given their beliefs about the actions of others. The DAG assumes that players know what game is being played (Game), though this could also be included for more fundamental justification of behavioral predictions. Each action is taken as a function of the beliefs about the game, the expectations about the actions of others, and knowledge of play to date. The functional equationsnot shownare given by optimization and belief formation assuming optimization by others. Figure 4.6: The upper panel shows a causal graph that describes relations between nodes suggested by analysis of the game in Figure and which can imply the causal graph of Figure . The game itself (or beliefs about the game) appear as a node, which are in turn determined by exogneous factors. The lower panel represents a still lower level and more general theory ``players use backwards induction in three step games of complete information. These lower level graphs can themselves provide clues for assessing relations in the higher level graphs. For instance, the lower level model might specify that the value of \\(b\\) in the game affects the actions of the government only through their beliefs about the behavior of voters, \\(E\\). These beliefs may themselves have a stochastic component, \\(U_E\\). Thus \\(b\\) high might be thought to reduce the effect of media on corruption. For instance if \\(b \\in \\mathbb{R}_+\\), we have \\(C= 1-FG(1-\\mathbb{1}(b&gt;1))\\). If \\(X\\) is unobserved and one is interested in whether \\(S=0\\) caused corruption, knowledge of \\(b\\) is informative. It is a root node in the causal estimand. If \\(b&gt;1\\) then \\(S=0\\) did not cause corruption. However if \\(b\\) matters only because of its effect on \\(E\\) then the query depends on \\(U_E\\). In this case, while knowing \\(b\\) is informative about whether \\(S=0\\) caused \\(C=1\\), knowing \\(E\\) from the lower level graph is more informative. Note that the model we have examined here involves no terms for \\(U_C\\), \\(U_R\\) and \\(U_Y\\)that is, shocks to outcomes given action. Yet clearly any of these could exist. One could imagine a version of this game with trembling hands, such that errors are always made with some small probability, giving rise to a much richer set of predictions. These can be represented in the game tree as moves by nature between actions chosen and outcomes realized. Importantly in a strategic environment such noise could give rise to different types of conditional independence. For instance say that a Free Press only published its report on corruption with probability \\(\\pi^R\\), then with \\(\\pi^R\\) high enough the sensitive government might decide it is worth engaging in corruption even if there is a free press; in this case the arrow from \\(X\\) to \\(C\\) would be removed. Interestingly in this case as the error rate rises, \\(R\\) becomes less likely, meaning that the effect of a \\(S\\) on \\(Y\\) becomes gradually weaker (since governments that are not sensitive become more likely to survive) and then drops to 0 as sensitive governments start acting just like nonsensitive governments.
