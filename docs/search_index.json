Let’s assume that the true effect of 0.5, but that this is not known to researchers. The .5 effect comes from the difference between the share of units with a positive effect (.6) and those with a negative effect (.1). (We say share but we may as well think in terms of the probability that a given unit is of one or other type.) model &lt;- set_parameters(model, c(.5, .5, .2, .1, .6, .1)) kable(t(model$parameters)) X.X0 X.X1 Y.Y00 Y.Y10 Y.Y01 Y.Y11 0.5 0.5 0.2 0.1 0.6 0.1 We can now simulate data using the model: data &lt;- simulate_data(model, n = 1000) With a model and data in hand we can now update the model. updated &lt;- gbiqq(model, data) From the updated model we can draw posterior inferences over estimands of interest. We will imagine three estimands, corresponding to Pearl’s “ladder of causation.” At the first level we are interested in the distribution of some node, perhaps given the value of another node. This question is answerable from observational data. At the second level we are interested in treatment effects: how changing one node changes another. This question is answerable from experimental data. At the third level we are interested in counterfactual statements: how would things have been different if some features of the world were different from what they are? Answering this question requires a causal model. Here are the results: results &lt;- gbiqq::query_model( updated, queries = list(&quot;Y | X=1&quot; = &quot;Y&quot;, ATE = &quot;Y[X=1] - Y[X=0]&quot;, PC = &quot;Y[X=1] &gt; Y[X=0]&quot;), subsets = c(TRUE, TRUE, &quot;X==1 &amp; Y==1&quot;), using = &quot;posteriors&quot;) Query (rung) Query Subset Using mean sd Association Y | X=1 All posteriors 0.48 0.02 Intervention ATE All posteriors 0.53 0.03 Imagining PC X==1 &amp; Y==1 posteriors 0.86 0.08 We see from the posterior variance on PC that we have the greatest difficulty with the third rung. In particular the PC is not identified (the distribution does not tighten even with very large N). For more intuition we graph the posteriors: We find that they do not converge but they do place positive mass in the right range. Within this range, the shape of the posterior depends on the priors only. 17.2 \\(X\\) causes \\(Y\\), with unmodelled confounding An \\(X\\) causes \\(Y\\) model with confounding can be written: model &lt;- make_model(&quot;X -&gt; Y&quot;) %&gt;% set_confound(list(X = &quot;(Y[X=1]&gt;Y[X=0])&quot;, X = &quot;(Y[X=1]&lt;Y[X=0])&quot;, X = &quot;(Y[X=1] ==1)&quot;)) plot_dag(model) If we look at the parameter matrix implied by this model we see that it has more parameters than nodal types, reflecting the conditional assignment probabilities of \\(X\\) – \\(X\\) can have different assignment probabilities for different nodal types for \\(Y\\). Table 17.1: Parameter matrix for X causes Y model with arbitrary confounding X0.Y00 X1.Y00 X0.Y10 X1.Y10 X0.Y01 X1.Y01 X0.Y11 X1.Y11 X0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 X1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 X0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 X1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 X0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 X1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 X0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 X1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 Y00 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 Y10 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 Y01 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 Y11 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 With the possibility of any type of confounding, the best we can do is place “Manski bounds” on the average causal effect. To see this, let’s plot a histogram of our posterior on average causal effects, given lots of data: data &lt;- simulate_data( model, n = 1000, parameters = c(.5, .5, .5, .5, .5, .5, .5, .5, .1, .1, .7, .1)) updated &lt;- gbiqq(model, data, refresh = 0) ## Prior distribution added to model The key thing here is that the posterior on the ATE has shifted, as it should, but it is not tight, even with large data. In fact the distribution of the posterior covers one unit of the range between -1 and 1. 17.3 An \\(X\\) causes \\(Y\\), with confounding modeled Say now we have a theory that the relationship between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) is confounded by possibly unobserved variable \\(C\\). Although \\(C\\) is unobserved we can still include it in the model and observe the confounding it generates by estimating the model on data generated by the model but assuming that we cannot observe \\(C\\). model &lt;- make_model(&quot;C -&gt; X -&gt; Y &lt;- C&quot;) %&gt;% set_restrictions(c( &quot;(Y[X=1] &lt; Y[X=0]) | (Y[C=1] &lt; Y[C=0])&quot;, &quot;(X[C=1] &lt; X[C=0])&quot;)) %&gt;% set_parameters(type = &quot;prior_mean&quot;) The ATE estimand in this case is given by: Query Subset Using mean ATE All parameters 0.333 In the first column below we run a regression using data generated from this model but with \\(C\\) unobserved. The second column shows what we would estimate if were able to observe \\(C\\).

To illustrate we will use the same data but assume priors from model where we do not restrict the relationship between \\(C\\) and \\(Y\\) and show the joint distribution of our posteriors. model &lt;- make_model(&quot;C -&gt; X -&gt; Y &lt;- C&quot;) %&gt;% set_restrictions(&quot;(X[C=1] &lt; X[C=0])&quot;) ate &lt;- read_rds(&quot;saved/appendix_modelled_confound_ate.rds&quot;) confound &lt;- read_rds(&quot;saved/appendix_modelled_confound_confound.rds&quot;) plot(ate, confound) abline(lm(confound~ate), col = &quot;red&quot;) 17.4 Illustration of the backdoor criterion We can use the same model to illustrate the backdoor criterion. We want to show that estimates of the treatment effect are identified if we have data on \\(C\\) but not otherwise. model &lt;- make_model(&quot;C -&gt; X -&gt; Y &lt;- C&quot;) %&gt;% set_parameters(type = &quot;prior_mean&quot;) %&gt;% set_restrictions(&quot;(Y[C=1]&lt;Y[C=0])&quot;) # Four types of data N &lt;- 10000 df_close_large &lt;- simulate_data(model, n = N) df_open_large &lt;- mutate(data_1_large, C = NA) df_close_small &lt;- data_1_large[sample(N, 200), ] df_open_small &lt;- data_2_large[sample(N, 200), ] We see that with small \\(n\\) (200 units), closing the backdoor (by including data on \\(C\\)) produces a tighter distribution on the ATE. With large \\(N\\) (10,000 units) the distribution around the estimand collapses when the backdoor is closed but not when it is open. 17.5 Simple mediation model We define a simple mediation model and illustrate learning about whether \\(X=1\\) caused \\(Y=1\\) from observations of \\(M\\). model &lt;- make_model(&quot;X -&gt; M -&gt; Y&quot;) %&gt;% set_confound(confound = list(X = &quot;M[X=1]==1&quot;)) %&gt;% set_parameters(c(.5, .5, .2, .8, .2, 0, .8, 0, .2, 0, .8, 0)) plot_dag(model) Data and estimation: data &lt;- simulate_data(model, n = 1000, using = &quot;parameters&quot;) updated &lt;- gbiqq(model, data) result &lt;- gbiqq::query_model( updated, queries = list(COE = &quot;c(Y[X=1] &gt; Y[X=0])&quot;), subsets = c(&quot;X==1 &amp; Y==1&quot;, &quot;X==1 &amp; Y==1 &amp; M==0&quot;, &quot;X==1 &amp; Y==1 &amp; M==1&quot;), using = &quot;posteriors&quot;) Query Subset Using mean sd COE X==1 &amp; Y==1 posteriors 0.913 0.192 COE X==1 &amp; Y==1 &amp; M==0 posteriors 0.039 0.106 COE X==1 &amp; Y==1 &amp; M==1 posteriors 0.914 0.192 Note that observation of \\(M=0\\) results in a 0 probability for the posterior that \\(X\\) caused \\(Y\\), while observation of \\(M=1\\) has only a modest positive effect. The mediator thus provides a hoop test for the proposition that \\(X\\) caused \\(Y\\). 17.6 Simple moderator model We define a simple model with a moderator and illustrate how updating about COE is possible using the value of a mediator as a clue. model &lt;- make_model(&quot;X -&gt; Y; Z -&gt; Y&quot;) plot_dag(model) data &lt;- simulate_data( model, n = 1000, parameters = c(.5, .5, .5, .5, .02, .02, .02, .02, .02, .02, .02, .02, .02, .70, .02, .02, .02, .02, .02, .02)) posterior &lt;- gbiqq(model, data) result &lt;- gbiqq::query_model( updated, queries = list(COE = &quot;Y[X=1] &gt; Y[X=0]&quot;), subsets = list(&quot;X==1 &amp; Y==1&quot;, &quot;X==1 &amp; Y==1 &amp; Z==0&quot;, &quot;X==1 &amp; Y==1 &amp; Z==1&quot;), using = &quot;posteriors&quot;) Query Subset Using mean sd COE X==1 &amp; Y==1 posteriors 0.795 0.044 COE X==1 &amp; Y==1 &amp; Z==0 posteriors 0.404 0.143 COE X==1 &amp; Y==1 &amp; Z==1 posteriors 0.883 0.037 As an exercise, define a model where, learning about a model with moderators allows you to tighten bounds on COE even without observing the value of the mediator. 17.7 Billy and Suzy’s moderator and mediation model We can describe a simple version of the Billy and Suzy stone throwing game as a model with moderation and mediation in three nodes. model &lt;- make_model(&quot;Suzy -&gt; Billy -&gt; Smash &lt;- Suzy&quot;) %&gt;% set_restrictions(c( # If Suzy throws the bottle breaks &quot;(Smash[Suzy=1]==0)&quot;, # The bottle won&#39;t break by itself &quot;(Smash[Billy=0, Suzy = 0]==1)&quot;, # Suzy&#39;s throw doesn&#39;t *encourage* Billy to throw &quot;Billy[Suzy=1]&gt;Billy[Suzy=0]&quot;)) plot_dag(model) Here “Suzy” means Suzy throws, “Billy”: means Billy throws—which he might not do if Suzy throws—and “Smash” means the bottle gets smashed. The version here is a somewhat less deterministic version of the classic account. Suzy is still an ace shot but now she may or may not throw and Billy may or may not respond positively to Suzy and if he does respond he may or may not be successful. With all these possibilities we have twelve unit causal types instead of 1. We have two estimands of interest: counterfactual causation and actual causation. Conditional on Suzy throwing and the bottle breaking, would the bottle not have broken had Suzy not thrown her stone. That’s counterfactual causation. The actual causation asks the same question but conditioning on the fact that Billy did or did not thrown his stone—which we know could itself be due to Suzy throwing her stone. If so then we might think of an “active path” from Suzy’s throw to the smashing, even though had she not thrown the bottle would have smashed anyhow. Our results: actual_cause &lt;- query_model(model, using = &quot;priors&quot;, queries = c( Counterfactual = &quot;Smash[Suzy = 1] &gt; Smash[Suzy = 0]&quot;, Actual = &quot;Smash[Suzy = 1, Billy = Billy[Suzy = 1] ] &gt; Smash[Suzy = 0, Billy = Billy[Suzy = 1]]&quot;), subsets = c(&quot;Suzy==1 &amp; Smash==1&quot;, &quot;Suzy==1 &amp; Smash==1 &amp; Billy==0&quot;, &quot;Suzy==1 &amp; Smash==1 &amp; Billy==1&quot;), expand_grid = TRUE ) Query Subset Using mean sd Counterfactual Suzy==1 &amp; Smash==1 priors 0.669 0.234 Counterfactual Suzy==1 &amp; Smash==1 &amp; Billy==0 priors 0.754 0.217 Counterfactual Suzy==1 &amp; Smash==1 &amp; Billy==1 priors 0.498 0.288 Actual Suzy==1 &amp; Smash==1 priors 0.832 0.168 Actual Suzy==1 &amp; Smash==1 &amp; Billy==0 priors 1.000 0.000 Actual Suzy==1 &amp; Smash==1 &amp; Billy==1 priors 0.498 0.288 Our inferences, without even observing Billy’s throw distinguish between Suzy being a counterfactual cause and an actual cause. We think it likely that Suzy’s throw was an actual cause of the outcome though we are less sure that it was a counterfactual causes. Observing Billy’s throw strengthens our inferences. If Billy didn’t throw then we are sure Suzy’s throw was the actual cause, though we are still in doubt about whether her throw was a counterfactual cause. Note that if we observed Suzy not throwing then we would learn more about whether she would be a counterfactual cause since we would have learned more about whether Billy reacts to her and also about whether Billy is a good shot.

The ATE can be gotten fairly precisely in a simple regression.

It provides an ability to make different PC case level claims given W, but these are nevertheless far off in this example because we still do not have identification.

This is the stuff of medical diagnosis: on observing symptoms, is the sickness due to \\(A\\) or to \\(B\\)? We imagine cases in which we do not get to observe the putative cause directly and we want to infer both whether the putative cause was present and whether it caused the outcome. This requires stating a query on both an effect and the level of an unobserved node. An illustration: model &lt;- make_model(&quot;A -&gt; S -&gt; Y &lt;- B&quot;) %&gt;% set_restrictions(c(&quot;(S[A=1]&lt; S[A=0])&quot;, &quot;(Y[S=1]&lt;Y[S=0])&quot;, &quot;(Y[S = 0, B = 0]== 1)&quot;)) query_model(model, queries = list(A=&quot;(Y[A=1] &gt; Y[A =0]) &amp; A==1&quot;, B=&quot;(Y[B=1] &gt; Y[B =0]) &amp; B==1&quot;), subsets = list(&quot;Y==1&quot;, &quot;Y==1 &amp; S==1&quot;), using = &quot;priors&quot;, expand_grid = TRUE) %&gt;% kable Query Subset Using mean sd A Y==1 priors 0.199 0.204 A Y==1 &amp; S==1 priors 0.255 0.231 B Y==1 priors 0.439 0.259 B Y==1 &amp; S==1 priors 0.285 0.218 In this example there are two possible causes of interest, \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). With flat priors the \\(B\\) path starts as more probable. Observation of symptom \\(S\\), which is a consequence of \\(A\\), however raises the chances that the outcome is due to \\(A\\) and lowers the chances that it is due to \\(B\\). 17.13 A model mixing observational and experimental data We imagine that node \\(R\\) indicates whether a unit was assigned to be randomly assigned to treatment assignment (\\(X=Z\\) if \\(R=1\\)) or took on its observational value (\\(X=O\\) if \\(R=0\\)). We assume the exclusion restriction that entering the experimental sample is not related to \\(Y\\) other than through assignment of \\(X\\). model &lt;- make_model(&quot;R -&gt; X; O -&gt;X; Z -&gt; X; X -&gt; Y&quot;, add_priors = FALSE) %&gt;% set_restrictions(&quot;(X[R=1, Z=0]!=0) | (X[R=1, Z=1]!=1) | (X[R=0, O=0]!=0) | (X[R=0, O=1]!=1)&quot;) %&gt;% set_priors() %&gt;% set_confound(list(O = &quot;(Y[X=1] &gt; Y[X=0])&quot;, O = &quot;(Y[X=1] &lt; Y[X=0])&quot;, O = &quot;(Y[X=1] == 1)&quot;)) plot_dag(model) The parameter matrix has just one type for \\(X\\) since \\(X\\) really operates here as a kind of switch, inheriting the value of \\(Z\\) or \\(O\\) depending on \\(R\\). Parameters allow for complete confounding between \\(O\\) and \\(Y\\) by \\(Z\\) and \\(Y\\) are unconfounded. model &lt;- set_parameters(model, c(.2, .8, .8, .2, .2, .8, .8, .2, .5, .5, .5, .5, 1, .2, .2, .4, .2)) The estimands: Query Subset Using mean ATE All parameters 0.2 ATE R==0 parameters 0.2 ATE R==1 parameters 0.2 The priors: Query Subset Using mean sd ATE All priors -0.003 0.31 ATE R==0 priors -0.003 0.31 ATE R==1 priors -0.003 0.31 Data: data &lt;- simulate_data(model, n = 600) # Uncomment if data on $O$ is not available for cases assigned to $R=1$. # data$O[data$R == 1] &lt;- NA The true effect is .2 but naive analysis on the observational data would yield a srtongly upwardly biased estimate.

The key feature is that data is only seen for units with \\(S=1\\). In this model the relationship between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) is confounded. Controlling for either \\(Z\\) or for \\(W1\\) and \\(W2\\) can address this confounding, but only controlling for \\(Z\\) can capture sample selection. The reason is that \\(Z\\) is independent of \\(S\\) and so variation in \\(Z\\) is not affected by selection on \\(S\\). fusion &lt;- make_model(&quot;X &lt;- W1 -&gt; W2 -&gt; X -&gt; Y &lt;- Z -&gt; W2; W1 -&gt; S&quot;) To keep the parameter and type space small we also impose a set of restrictions: \\(S\\) is non decreasing in \\(W_1\\), \\(X\\) is not decreasing in either \\(W1\\) or \\(W2\\), \\(Y\\) is not decreasing \\(Z\\) or \\(X\\) and \\(X\\) affects \\(Y\\) only if \\(Z=1\\). \\(W_2=1\\) if and only if both \\(W_1=1\\) and \\(Z=1\\). These all reduce the problem to one with 18 nodal types and 288 causal types. Given these priors we will assume a true (unknown) dgp with no effect of \\(X\\) on \\(Y\\), in which \\(W_1\\) arises with a \\(1/3\\) probability but has a strong positive effect on selection into the sample when it does arise. The estimand values given the true parameters and priors for this model are as shown below. Table 17.4: Estimand values Query Subset Using mean sd Q 1 All parameters 0.000 NA Q 1 All priors 0.124 0.133 We can see the inference challenge from observational data using regression analysis with and without conditioning on \\(Z\\).
