We draw out the implications of this idea for case selection. A critical decision for scholars employing mixed methods is to determine which cases are most valuable for within-case analysis. A host of different strategies have been proposed for selecting cases for in-depth study based on the observed values of \\(X\\), \\(Y\\) data. Perhaps the most common strategy is to select cases in which \\(X=1\\) and \\(Y=1\\) and look to see whether in fact \\(X\\) caused \\(Y\\) in the case in question (using some more or less formal strategy for inferring causality from within-case evidence). But many other strategies have been proposed, including strategies to select cases on the regression line or, for some purposes, cases off the regression line (e.g., Lieberman (2005)). Some scholars suggest ensuring variation in \\(X\\) (most prominently, King, Keohane, and Verba (1994)), while others have proposed various kinds of matching strategies. Some have pointed to the advantages of random sampling of cases, either stratified or unstratified by values on \\(X\\) or \\(Y\\) (Fearon and Laitin (2008), Herron and Quinn (2016)). Which cases you should choose will likely depend on the purposes to which you want to put them. A matching strategy for instanceselecting cases that are comparable on many features but that differ on \\(X\\)replicates at a small scale the kind of inference done by matching estimators with large-\\(n\\) data. The strategy emphasize the inferences to be made from \\(X,Y\\) variation rather than inferences drawn specifically from within case information beyond what is available in the measurement of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\). (Citations needed.) Other treatments seek to use qualitative information to check assumptions made in \\(X, Y\\) analysis: for example, is the measurement of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) reliable in critical cases? (Citations needed) For such questions with limited resources, it might make sense to focus on cases for which validation plausibly makes a difference to the \\(X,Y\\) inferences: for example influential cases that have unusually extreme values on \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\).1 Similar arguments are made for checking assumptions on selection processes, though we consider this a more complex desideratum since this requires making case level causal inferences and not simply measurement claims. A third purpose is to use a case to generate alternative or richer theories of causal processes, as in Liebermans model-building mode of nested analysis (Lieberman (2005)). Here it may be cases off the regression line that are of interest. Weller and Barnes (CITE article) on case selection focus on (a) X/Y relations and (b) whether the cases are useful for hypothesis generation. In what follows, we focus on a simpler goal: given existing \\(X, Y\\) data for a set of cases and a given clue (or set of clues) that we can go looking for in the intensive analysis of some subset of these cases, for which cases would process tracing yield the greatest learning about the population-level causal effect of \\(X\\) on \\(Y\\)? The basic insight of this chapter is simple enough: the optimal strategy for case selection for a model-based analysis can be determined by the model and the query, just as we saw for the optimal clue-selection strategy in Chapter ??. Using this strategy yields guidance that is consistent with some common advice but at odds with other advice. The main principles that emerge from the analysis can be summarized as: go where the probative value is, and sample from \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) values in proportion to their occurrence in the population, invest in collections of cases that provide complementary learning. Beyond these general principles, other patterns are more complex and thus more difficult to neatly summarize. The most general message of this chapter is about the general approach: that is, that we can use a causal model to tell us what kinds of cases are likely to yield the greatest learning, given the model and a strategy of inference. We provide a tool for researchers to undertake this analysis, at least for simple problems with \\(X, Y, K\\) data. Most closely related to our analysis in this chapter is the contribution of Herron and Quinn (2016), who build on Seawright and Gerring (2008). While Seawright and Gerring provide a taxonomy of approaches to case selection, they do not provide a strategy for assessing the relative merits of these different approaches. As we do, Herron and Quinn (2016) focus on a situation with binary \\(X,Y\\) data and assess the gains from learning about causal type in a set of cases (interestingly in their treatment causal type, \\(Z_i\\) is called a confounder rather than being an estimand of direct interest; in our setup, confounding as normally understood arises because of different probabilities of different causal types of being assigned to treatment, or an \\(X=1\\) value). Herron and Quinn (2016) assume that in any given case selected for analysis a qualitative researcher is able to infer the causal type perfectly. Our setup differs from that in Herron and Quinn (2016) in a few ways. Herron and Quinn (2016) paramaterize differently, though this difference is not important.2 Perhaps the most important difference between our analysis and that in Herron and Quinn (2016) is that we connect the inference strategy to process-tracing approaches. Whereas Herron and Quinn (2016) assume that causal types can be read directly, we assume that these are inferred imperfectly from clues. As in our baseline model, our ability to make inferences for causal types can differ by type and as a function of \\(X\\). And, as in the baseline model, not only can we have uncertainty about the probative value of clues, but researchers can learn about the probative value of clues by examining cases. Here we assume that the case selection decision is made after observing the \\(XY\\) distribution and we explore a range of different possible contingency tables. In Herron and Quinn (2016) the distribution from which the contingency tables are drawn is fixed, though set to exhibit an expected observed difference in means (though not necessarily a true treatment effect) of 0.2. They assume large \\(XY\\) data sets (with 10,000) units and case selection strategies ranging from 1 to 20 cases. Another important difference, is that in many of their analyses, Herron and Quinn (2016) take the perspective of an outside analyst who knows the true treatment effect; they then assess the expected bias generated by a research strategy over the possible data realizations. We, instead, take the perspective of a researcher who has beliefs about the true treatment effect that correspond to their priors, and for whom there is therefore no expected bias. This has consequences also for the assessment of expected posterior variance, as in our analyses the expectation of the variance is taken with respect to the researchers beliefs about the world, rather than being made conditional on some specific world (ATE). We think that this setup is addressed to the question that a researcher must answer when deciding on a strategy: given what they know now, what will produce the greatest reduction in uncertainty (the lowest expected posterior variance)? Finally, we proceed somewhat differently in our identification of strategies from Herron and Quinn: rather than pre-specifying particular sets of strategies (operationalizations of those identified by Seawright and Gerring (2008)) and evaluating them, we define a strategy as the particular distribution over \\(XY\\) cells to be examined and proceed to examine every possible strategy given a choice of a certain number of cases in which to conduct process tracing. We thus let the clusters of strategiesthose strategies that perform similarlyemerge from the analysis rather than being privileged by past conceptualizations of case-selection strategies. Despite these various differences, our results will agree in key ways with those in Herron and Quinn (2016). 15.1 Case selection logics depends on probative value and queries Although it might be tempting to seek general rules of the form examine cases in which \\(X=1\\) and \\(Y=1\\) or, ignore cases in which \\(X=0\\) and \\(Y=0\\), it is easily demonstrated that which choices are more informative depend on how waht can be learned within a case contributes to infernecnce, and that hte contributions depend on the query in question. Say we know in a given population that: \\(X \\rightarrow Y \\leftarrow K\\) \\(\\Pr(Y=1|X=0, K = 0) = 1\\) \\(\\Pr(Y=1|X=1, K = 0) = .5\\) \\(\\Pr(Y=1|X=0, K = 1) = 0\\) \\(\\Pr(Y=1|X=1, K = 1) = .9\\) We do not know, however how common \\(K\\) is. Thus we do not know either unit level causal effects or population level effects. Given the information above we can see that if \\(X=Y=1\\), then \\(K\\) is a doubly decisive clue for assessing whether, in a given case, \\(X\\) causes \\(Y\\). In particular we have that for an \\(X=Y=1\\) case, seeing \\(K=1\\) implies \\(X\\) caused \\(Y\\) Since otherwise \\(Y\\) would have been 0) and seeing \\(K=0\\) implies \\(X\\) did not cause \\(Y\\) (since othereise \\(Y\\) would have been 1 in any event. However, if we had a case in which \\(X=Y=0\\) then learning \\(K\\) would be entirely uninformative for the case. In particular, we already know that \\(K=1\\) in this case as we know there are not cases in which \\(X=Y=0\\) and \\(K=0\\). And this knowledge is not enough in this case to know whether \\(X=0\\) caused \\(Y=0\\). For the same reason, if, off the diagonal, \\(X=0, Y=1\\) we learn nothing from \\(K\\), since we learn about \\(K\\) from \\(Y\\). If however we had a case in which \\(X=1, Y=0\\), if \\(K\\) were 1 then we would know that \\(X=1\\) did not cause \\(Y=0\\); if \\(K\\) were 0 we would know that \\(X=1\\) caused \\(Y=1\\). Say now we were interested in the population estimand: the average effect of \\(X\\) on \\(Y\\). We can see that this is equal to \\(\\Pr(K=1)\\times.9 + (1-\\Pr(K-0))\\times(-.5)) = 1.4\\Pr(K=1)-.5\\). For this estimand we are only interested in the prevalence of \\(K\\) in the population. It might seem that this means that it is irrelevant what type of case you choose; however, as noted above, we have more information about the likely value of \\(K\\) in some cases than in others. So for this estimand also, in this case, selecting an \\(X=Y=1\\) case is informative for the population effect; selecting \\(X=Y=0\\) case is not informative. Say now we had a case in which \\(X=1\\). Should we choose: a case in which \\(Y=1\\) or a case in which \\(Y=0\\). In both cases \\(K\\) is doubly decisive for the case level estimand. However for a \\(Y=1\\) case we think it likely that \\(K=1\\) (specifically, assuming a prior of \\(\\Pr(K=1)\\) we think \\(\\Pr(K=1 | X=1, Y=1) = \\frac{.9}{.9+.5}=.64\\)); for the \\(Y=0\\) case we think \\(\\Pr(K=1 | X=1, Y=0) = \\frac{.1}{.5+.1}=.17\\). Thus we are much more uncertain about the value of \\(K\\) in the \\(X=Y=1\\) case. We would learn more for the avergae treatment effect then by choosing off the diagonal. Specifically let \\(\\kappa\\) denote \\(\\Pr(K=1)\\). say we begin thinking it equally likely that \\(\\kappa=\\kappa^H = .5\\) and \\(\\kappa=\\kappa^L=0\\). Say \\(\\Pr(X=1) = .5\\). Say we observe one case with \\(X=Y=1\\) and another with \\(X=1, Y=0\\). From that informaation alone we can update over \\(\\kappa\\). Specifically, conditioning on the probability that \\(X=1\\) for both cases and focuseing only on the probability that Y=0 in one case and Y=1 in the other: \\[p(\\kappa = \\kappa^L|D) = \\frac{p(D|\\kappa^H)}{p(D|\\kappa^H)+p(D|\\kappa^L)}=\\frac{.5}{.5 + .25\\times(2\\times.5\\times.5 + 2\\times.9\\times.1 + 2\\times(.9\\times.5 +.1\\times.5))}\\] In summary in this case it makes sense to select and \\(X=Y=1\\) case if you are interested in teh population estimand or if you are interested in teh case level estimand for an \\(X=Y=1\\) case. If you are interested in the case level estimand for an \\(X=Y=0\\) case then there are no gains from either selection strategy. Sometimes however you learn more in a \\(X=Y=0\\) than in a \\(X=Y=1\\) case. Say instead that you knew that: \\(X \\rightarrow Y \\leftarrow K\\) \\(\\Pr(Y=1|X=0, K = 0) = .5\\) \\(\\Pr(Y=1|X=1, K = 0) = 0\\) \\(\\Pr(Y=1|X=0, K = 1) = .5\\) \\(\\Pr(Y=1|X=1, K = 1) = 1\\) In this case you learn nothing from observing a case in which \\(X=Y=1\\)in this case you already expect that \\(K=1\\). In contrast if \\(X=Y=0\\) then if you learn that \\(K=1\\) you know that were \\(X=1\\) the \\(Y\\) would have been 1; but if you learn that \\(K=0\\) you know that were \\(X=1\\) then \\(Y\\) would have (still) been 0. So in this case \\(K\\) is doubly decisive for an \\(X=Y=0\\) case but not for a \\(X=Y=1\\) case. This logic also holds for the off diagonals. Say instead that you knew that: \\(X \\rightarrow Y \\leftarrow K\\) \\(\\Pr(Y=1|X=0, K = 0) = 0\\) \\(\\Pr(Y=1|X=1, K = 0) = .5\\) \\(\\Pr(Y=1|X=0, K = 1) = 1\\) \\(\\Pr(Y=1|X=1, K = 1) = .5\\) Say you have a case in which \\(X=1, Y=0\\), then if \\(K=1\\) you know that if \\(X\\) were 0, Y would have been 1; but if \\(K=0\\) you know that if \\(X\\) were 0, \\(Y\\) would have been 0. In that case \\(K\\) would be doubly decisive for \\(X=1\\) causing \\(Y=0\\). Say you have a case in which \\(X=0, Y=1\\), then it must be that \\(K=0\\). Say instead that you knew that: \\(X \\rightarrow Y \\leftarrow K\\) \\(\\Pr(Y=1|X=0, K = 0) = .5\\) \\(\\Pr(Y=1|X=1, K = 0) = 0\\) \\(\\Pr(Y=1|X=0, K = 1) = .5\\) \\(\\Pr(Y=1|X=1, K = 1) = 1\\) It may be better to select a case that is not like the cases you want to make inferences about. Which cases to learn \\(K\\) from. 15.2 Logic of strategy comparison Consider a situation in which one has access to \\(X,Y\\) data on just six cases of the form: event count X0Y0 2 X1Y0 1 X0Y1 1 X1Y1 2 We want to examine data on \\(M\\) for two of these cases and are wondering about what strategy we should use to select the cases. We are considering three strategies: Strategy \\(A\\) chooses two cases on the regression line (one in the \\(X=Y=0\\) cell and one in the \\(X=Y=1\\) cell) Strategy \\(B\\) chooses off the regression line Strategy \\(C\\) selects on the dependent variable  choosing cases with \\(X=1, Y = 1\\). Different strategies yield different possible types of data. Each one of these is likely to arise with a different probability and is associated with a different inference. Drawing on the prior beliefs embedded in a causal model, we can thus assess the expected posterior variance associated with each strategy. For each of these possible strategies we can assess the posterior that we would obtain for each type of data we might observe. The data possibilities, probabilities of each, and inferences given each, are shown in Table 15.1. Table 15.1: Each column shows a possible distribution of data that can be generated from a given strategy. We calculate the probability of each data possibility, given the data seen so far, and the posterior variance associated with each one. event A1 A2 A3 A4 B1 B2 B3 B4 C1 C2 C3 X0M0Y0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 X0M0Y1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 X0M1Y0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 X0M1Y1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 X0Y0 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 X0Y1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 X1M0Y0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 X1M0Y1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 1 0 X1M1Y0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 X1M1Y1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 X1Y0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 X1Y1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 Probability 0.171 0.03 0.625 0.174 0.27 0.231 0.23 0.268 0.09 0.242 0.668 Posterior mean 0.078 0.041 0.171 0.078 0.128 0.141 0.143 0.131 0.046 0.089 0.161 Posterior variance 0.006 0.002 0.029 0.006 0.016 0.02 0.02 0.017 0.002 0.008 0.026 Each of the first two strategies generates one of four different data patterns. The third data strategy generates up to three data patterns. None of these data patterns overlap across strategies. From the calculated probability of each data type, given the data seen so far, and the posterior variance given each data realization, the implied expected variance is easily calculated. These are summarized below: Strategy Variance Online 0.015 Offline 0.017 X=1, Y=1 0.015 In this example, we see that we would expect to be better offin the sense of having less posterior uncertaintyby focusing her process-tracing efforts where a greater share of the population of cases lies: on the regression line. Why is this? For intuition consider first the case with flat prior data: if we examine two cases in different quadrants on the diagonal (one \\(X=Y=0\\) case and one \\(X=Y=1\\) case) : if we find that \\(M\\) is the same in the two cases then we increase our belief that \\(X\\) has no effect at all on \\(Y\\) and reduce our confidence that \\(X\\) had a positive or a negative effect on \\(Y\\). Since we are looking on the regression line however, our confidence that \\(X\\) had a positive effect on \\(Y\\) is more strongly reduced, producing a posterior centered on a small negative effect. Conversely if we see that \\(M\\) is different in the two cases, then we have a correlation of the same sign between both \\(X\\) and \\(M\\) and between \\(M\\) and \\(Y\\) cases. We increase our confidence that \\(X\\) mattered for \\(Y\\) in general an din particular that it had a positive effect, resulting in a posterior centered on a small positive ATE. if we examine two cases in different quadrants off the diagonal (one \\(X=0, Y=1\\) case and one \\(X=1, Y=0\\) case) : if we find that \\(M\\) is the same in the two cases then we increase our belief that \\(X\\) has no effect at all on \\(Y\\) and reduce our confidence that \\(X\\) had a negative effect \\(Y\\) (producing a posterior centered on a small positive effect). Conversely if we see that \\(M\\) is different in the two cases, then we have a correlation (of different signs) between both \\(X\\) and \\(M\\) and between \\(M\\) and \\(Y\\) cases. We increase our confidence that \\(X\\) mattered for \\(Y\\) in general and in particular that it had a negative effect, resulting in a posterior centered on a small negative ATE. If we examine data conditioning on the value of \\(X\\) but with variation on \\(Y\\) (for instance \\(X=1, Y=0\\) and \\(X=1, Y=1\\)) data patterns do not discriminate between X having a positive effect on Y an d X having a negative effect on Y. However variation in \\(M\\) is more consistent with \\(M\\) being responsive to \\(X\\) and thus the chances that \\(X\\) matters, positively or negatively, overall. In teh case with flat data this changes beliefs on positve and negative effects but not the difference between them. The ate then remains unchanged. FLAG work though intuition more If we examine data conditioning on the value of \\(Y\\) but with variation on \\(X\\) (for instance \\(X=0, Y=1\\) and \\(X=1, Y=1\\)) data patterns do not discriminate between X having a positive effect on Y an d X having a negative effect on Y. However variation in \\(M\\) is more consistent with \\(M\\) being responsive to \\(X\\) and thus the chances that \\(X\\) matters, positively or negatively, overall. In teh case with flat data this changes beliefs on positve and negative effects but not the difference between them. The ate then remains unchanged. For correlated data similar logics apply, but the effects are stronger for evidence on the regression line. The reason is that given correlated data we believe there are more units with positive effects than negative effects. When we find evidence against causal relations on the regression line that reduces our confidence for types with positive effects more than for types with negative effects and teh difference between teh shares with positive effects and negative eeffects smaller due to the fact that the beliefs in the shares with negative effects is not so strongly reduced. Wehen we find evidence for causal relations this magnifies teh difference between beliefs in shares positive and shares negatives; these effects are magnified however since our confidence for the positive effects change more than for the negative effects, since we are examining cases on the regression line. Conversely when examining cases of teh regression line, the two forces offset each other. 15.3 Explorations Using the same basic logic we can explore performance across a wider range of strategies that might be employed under different conditions. The qualitative case-selection literature has identified a range of possible strategies for choosing cases for in-depth analysis. These include, for instance, selecting for variation on \\(X\\) (KKV), selecting for variation on \\(Y\\), selecting cases on the regression line (Seawright and Gerring, Lieberman), and selecting off the regression line (Seawright and Gerring, Seawright 2017, Lieberman).[These authors view selection off the regression line as best for arriving at inductive insight. We address this strategy primarily to show the contrast with the on-the-line strategy.] While we have not seen it advocated elsewhere, we might add to this list the strategy of selecting cases that are representative in their \\(X,Y\\) values of the larger set of cases from which we are selecting. (FLAG: insert proper citations). While it is difficult to clearly distinguish these strategies from each other with a small initial set of \\(X, Y\\) cases, we can do so readily if we start with a larger set of \\(X,Y\\) cases. In Table ??, we show the results of diagnoses of each of these five classes of strategies, assuming that we will be process-tracing 6 cases. In each diagnosis we start with 500 \\(X, Y\\) cases, with 100 \\(X=Y=0\\) cases, 200 \\(X=Y=1\\) cases, 130 \\(X=0, Y=1\\) cases, and 70 \\(X=1, Y=0\\) cases. The regression line here represents a positive association. We work with the same model and priors as above. Importantly, this means that the results we show here are not general evaluations of these strategies, but contingent on this particular model and set of priors. And that is precisely our point: optimal case-selection will always hinge on our model, a claim that we demonstrate further below. 15.3.1 Procedure The procedure requires as inputs (i) a causal model, (ii) any data we have already observed, and (iii) the causal query we seek to answer. The general intuition is that we can use the causal model and any previously observed data to estimate what observations we are more or less likely to make under a given case-selection strategy, and then figure out how far off from the (under the model) true estimand we can expect to be under the strategy, given whatever causal question we seek to answer. Suppose that we want to estimate the average treatment effect of \\(X\\) on \\(Y\\) in a population and have initially observed \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) data on a set of cases. Suppose that we are now considering gathering process-tracing evidence for one of these cases to inform our estimate of the ATE. There are many different case-selection strategies we might pursue, and each of these can give rise to different possible data and thus to different possible conclusions. What should we do? DAG. We start, as always, with a DAG representing our beliefs about which variables we believe to be direct causes of other variables. For the current illustration, suppose that we are operating with a simple mediation model, \\(X \\rightarrow M \\rightarrow Y\\). Given data. If we have already observed something in a set of cases, we can use this information to condition our strategy for searching for further information. For instance, if we have observed \\(X\\)s and \\(Y\\)s value in a set of cases, we might select cases for process tracing based on their values of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\). Further, what we have already observed in the cases may constrain what possible data we could end up with once we have collected the additional (process tracing) data. Priors. As when conducting mixed-method inference, we can set qualitative restrictions and/or differential quantitative weights on the (possibly conditional) nodal types in the model. And we can indicate our uncertainty over the latter, by setting the \\(\\alpha\\) parameters of the relevant Dirichlet distributions. For the current example, let us define restrictions at both the \\(M\\) and \\(Y\\) nodes, positing beliefs that \\(X\\) never has a negative effect on \\(M\\) and that \\(M\\) never has a negative effect on \\(Y\\). Let us further assume that we have flat priors over the remaining nodal types and posit similar assignment propensities for all types (no unobserved confounding). Query. We define our query. This might, for instance, be the share of cases in the population in which \\(X\\) has a positive effect on \\(Y\\); or it might be \\(X\\)s average effect on \\(Y\\). We can use the general procedure to identify case-selection strategies for any causal query that can be defined on a DAG. And, importantly, the optimal case-selection strategy may depend on the query. For instance, the best case-selection strategy for estimating the average causal effect of \\(X\\) on \\(Y\\) may not be the same as the best strategy for figuring out for what proportion of the population \\(X\\) has a positive effect on \\(Y\\). Define one or more strategies. A strategy is defined, generically, as the search for data on a given set of nodes, in a given number of cases randomly selected conditional on some information we already have about potential cases. Let us assume here that our strategy will involve uncovering \\(M\\)s value in 1 casebut we are wondering how to choose this case. Consider four possible strategies, conditional on the \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) values that we already know. We could do process tracing on a randomly selected \\(X=1, Y=1\\) case, a randomly selected \\(X=0, Y=0\\) case, the \\(X=1, Y=0\\) case, or the \\(X=0, Y=1\\) case. We itemize this set of possible strategies in the first column in Table ??. Possible data. For each strategy, there are multiple possible sets of data that we could end up observing. In particular, the data we could end up with will be the \\(X,Y\\) patterns we have already observed plus either \\(M=0\\) or \\(M=1\\) in the case that our strategy leads us to select for process tracing. We represent the data possibilities (showing just the possible \\(M\\) values) in the second column in Table ??. Thus, for instance, for a strategy in which we choose a random \\(X=1, Y=1\\) case, we could end up observing the initial \\(X,Y\\) pattern plus \\(M=0\\) in one of the \\(X=1, Y=1\\) cases, or the initial \\(X,Y\\) pattern plus \\(M=1\\) in one of the \\(X=1, Y=1\\) cases. Probability of the data. We now calculate a probability of each possible data realization, given the model and the data (the \\(X\\)s and \\(Y\\)s) that we have already observed. In practice, we do this in CQtools via simulation. Starting with the model together with our priors, we update our beliefs about \\(\\lambda\\) based on the initial \\(X,Y\\) data. This posterior now represents our prior for the purposes of the process tracing; it represents what we believe about causal-type share allocations in the population, having seen the \\(X,Y\\) data only. We then use this posterior to draw a series of \\(\\lambda\\) values. Given that the ambiguity matrix gives us the mapping from causal types to data realizations, we can calculate for each \\(lambda\\) draw the probability of each data possibility given that particular \\(\\lambda\\) and the strategy. We then average across repeated \\(\\lambda\\) draws. (Since \\(\\lambda\\)s are being drawn from our prior, we are automatically weighting more heavily those \\(\\lambda\\)s that we believe to be most likely.) We show the data probabilities in the third column of Table ??: one probability for each data-possibility given each strategy. Posterior variance on estimate given the data. For each data possibility, we can then use CQtools to ask what inference we would get from each data possibility, given whatever query we seek to answer. What we are in fact interested in for the purposes of case selection is the variance of the posterior. We indicate in the fourth column of Table ?? the posterior variance for each possible data realization. Expected posterior variance under each strategy. The quantity of ultimate interest is the posterior variance that we expect to end up with under each strategy. Calculating this expectation is now elementary as we have both the posterior variance arising from each data possibility and the probability of each data possibility (given our prior beliefs and the data already observed). The expected posterior variance is simply an average of the posterior variances under each data possibility, weighted by the probability of each data possibility. The final column provides the expected posterior variances, one for each strategy. Complicated as the procedure might seem, it can all be done in code using a single command from the CQtools package. diagnose_strategies( analysis_model = model, observed = observed, data_strategies = list( A_online = list(N=c(1,1), within = TRUE, vars = &quot;M&quot;, conditions = c(&quot;X==1 &amp; Y==1&quot;, &quot;X==0 &amp; Y==0&quot;)), B_offline = list(N=c(1,1), within = TRUE, vars = &quot;M&quot;, conditions = c(&quot;X==1 &amp; Y==0&quot;, &quot;X==0 &amp; Y==1&quot;)), C_X1Y1 = list(N=2, within = TRUE, vars = &quot;M&quot;, conditions = c(&quot;X==1 &amp; Y==1&quot;))), queries = &quot;Y[X=1] - Y[X=0]&quot; ) Table 15.2: The estimand and the expected estimate are the same under each data strategy. strategy estimand estimates MSE post_var estimands_database Prior 0.1347 0.1340 0.0238 0.0166 estimands_database1 A_online 0.1347 0.1406 0.0180 0.0156 estimands_database2 B_offline 0.1347 0.1359 0.0236 0.0175 estimands_database3 C_X1Y1 0.1347 0.1362 0.0197 0.0158 estimands_database4 D_random 0.1347 0.1377 0.0202 0.0163 Graph full set ## Joining, by = c(&quot;Query&quot;, &quot;given&quot;, &quot;model&quot;, &quot;N&quot;) ## Warning: Removed 100 rows containing missing values (geom_point). 15.4 Principles 15.4.1 Sometimes one case is not enough For on regression line cases, you can see cases where M correlates positively with X and Y correlates positively to Y; or cases where M is correlated with neither For off regression line cases, you can see cases where M correlates negatively with X and positively with Y, or vice versa; and you can see cases where M is correlated with neither. With no restrictions, you cant actually learn from a single data point because you have flat priors over X-&gt;M and M-&gt;Y effects. Youre only able to learn from correlations. 15.4.2 Different strategies for different estimands 15.4.3 Where the probative value is References "]]
