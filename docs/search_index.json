Lower level models serve as a theory for a higher level model if the higher level model can be deduced from the lower level model. The empirical content of a lower level model is the possible reduction in variance of the higher level model that it can provide. Theory plays an important role in this book’s use of causal models for causal inference. Yet the term “theory” in the empirical social sciences means very different things in different contexts. In this book, we will refer to a theory is an explanation of a phenomeon: a theory provides an account of how or under what conditions a set of causal relationships operate. Moreover, we can express both a theory and the claims being theorized as causal models. A theory, then, is a model that explains and implies another model—possibly with the help of some data. We discuss toward the end of the chapter how this definition of theory relates to common understandings of theory in the social sciences. First, however, we focus on unpacking our working definition. In embedding theorization within the world of causal models, we ultimately have an empirical objective in mind. Theorizing a causal relationship of interest, in our framework, means elaborating our causal beliefs about the world in greater detail. As we show in later chapters, theorizing in the form of a causal model allows us to generate research designs: to identify sources of inferential leverage and to explicitly and systematically link observations of components of a causal system to the causal questions we seek to answer. 3.1 Theories of “how”, theories of “when” To illustrate, let us return to our democratization example and consider first the very basic claim that inequality can have an affect on democratization. We represent this simple claim in Figure 3.1, Panel (a). In this simple model, \\(I\\) may sometimes have an effect of \\(D\\), and sometimes not; and that effect may be positive or negative. All of this will depend on the case’s causal type. In Chapter 2, we considered the idea that causal type may be conceptualized as a random disturbance, a \\(U\\) term, that can take on different type values (e.g., \\(a, b, c, d\\)) and that points into an outcome variable. To fix this idea going forward, we make a shift in notation and use \\(\\theta\\) to indicate that a node is a receptacle for causal types. Thus, \\(\\theta_D\\) here captures the case’s causal type, or \\(I\\)’s causal effect on \\(D\\) for a given case. In particular if we deploy our four-causal-type function from Chapter 2 we have: if \\(\\theta^D=a\\), then \\(D=1-I\\) (\\(I\\) has a negative causal effect on \\(D\\)) if \\(\\theta^D=b\\), then \\(D=I\\) (\\(I\\) has a positive causal effect on \\(D\\)) if \\(\\theta^D=c\\), then \\(D=0\\) (\\(I\\) has no causal effect) if \\(\\theta^D=d\\), then \\(D=1\\) (\\(I\\) has no causal effect) Knowing \\(\\theta\\) tells us how \\(D\\) responds to \\(I\\) and it ignores any heterogeneity between units as long they respond in the same way. For any causal type the model is consistent with \\(I\\)’s causal effect operating for different reasons for different units, but these differences are left entirely unaccounted for. Figure 3.1: DAG representations of three theories. DAGs only capture claims that one variable causes another, conditional on other variables. Theories (b) and (c) each imply theory (a). Pushing further we might then wonder how inequality might exert its effect on democratization. One possible answer, drawing on our model in Chapter 2 is that inequality can affect mass-mobilization, which in turn can affect democratization. This explanatory claim is visually represented in Panel (b) of the figure. Here, we can see that any effect of \\(I\\) on \\(D\\) runs through \\(M\\). There are details of this graph that we will delve into later. But for now, it is sufficient to see that we have partly explained variation left unexplained by model (a). Model (b) allows us to say, for instance, that whether inequality has an effect on democratization has to depend on whether inequality has an effect on mobilization. Model (b) thus theorizes, in one important sense, a part of inequality’s effect that is left untheorized in model (a). Alternatively, we might wonder when inequality causes democratization. Our simple claim, in panel (a), allows that \\(I\\) can cause \\(D\\), but provides no information about the conditions under which it does so. Those conditions are implicitly embedded within \\(\\theta^D\\), where they are left unspecified. We could, however, theorize some of what is left unsaid in in panel (a). We do this in panel (c), where we posit ethnic homogeneity (\\(E\\)) as a moderator of the inequality’s effect on democratization. Panel (c) represents a theory of panel (a) in that it can help account for variation in causal effects that is unaccounted for by the model in (a). Model (c) has thus given substantive meaning to an aspect of the phenomenon that was merely residual variation in Model (a). Model (a) provides no account of why inequality has the effects it does, relying fully on \\(\\theta^D\\) as a placeholder for this uncertainty. In Model (c), \\(\\theta^D\\) plays a more modest role, with ethnic homogeneity doing a good deal of the work of determining inequality’s possible effects. In sum, Model (b) and Model (c) each explain Model (a), if in slightly different ways. Model (b) answers the explanatory question, “How does inequality affect democratization when it does?” Model (c) answers the explanatory question, “Why does inequality’s effect on democratization vary?” Both theories provide richer, more interpretable accounts of the phenomenon of interest than the simpler model that they are theorizing. We note one final possibility. Imagine that we started with the quite specific claim that inequality sometimes has a positive effect on democratization and sometimes has no effect (with democratization happening for other reasons). Suppose we believed this claim to be true for some, possibly not well defined, domain of cases.1 Model (c) could serve as a theory of this more specific claim in that Model (c), paired with some data, could explain the claim. In particular, Model (c) paired with the data \\(E=1\\)—we are in an ethnically homogeneous context—produces the more specific claim. Here, it is the theory plus an observation of context that accounts for the specific claim. 3.2 Theory as a “lower-level” model We can, likewise, think of theories as implying the models they are theorizing. If you believe Model (b) in Figure ??, then you also must believe Model (a): if inequality can affect mobilization, which can affect democratization, then inequality can affect democratization. Similarly, if you believe Model (c), then you must also believe Model (a): if it is true that inequality can have positive, negative, and null effects on democratization that depend on ethnic homogeneity, then it is also true, more simply, that inequality can have positive, negative, and null effects on democratization. More formally, let us say that a causal model, \\(M^\\prime\\), is a theory of \\(M\\) if \\(M\\) is implied by \\(M^\\prime\\). Theory is, thus, all relative. \\(M^\\prime\\) might itself sit atop a theory, \\(M^{\\prime\\prime}\\), that implies \\(M^\\prime\\). To help fix the idea of theory as “supporting” or “underlying” the model(s) it theorizes, we refer to the theory, \\(M^\\prime\\), as a lower-level model relative to \\(M\\) and refer to \\(M\\) as a higher-level model relative to its theorization, \\(M^\\prime\\).2 Building on our discussion in Section 3.1, we can distill two ways in which lower-level models can relate to, or support, higher-level models: 3.2.1 Disggregating nodes A lower-level model, \\(M^\\prime\\), can be a representation of \\(M\\) in which a node in \\(M\\) has been disaggregated into multiple nodes. Figure 3.2: Here we represent the simple claim that one variable causes another, and two theories — lower-level models — that could explain this claim. Both model (b) and model (c) involve theorization via disaggregation of nodes. For instance, suppose we start with the higher-level model represented in Figure (a). We can then offer the graph in panel (b) as a theory, a lower-level model, of (a). Informally, we have added a step, \\(K\\), in the causal chain between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), a familiar mode of theorization, exactly parallel to our model of mediation by mobilization just above. More formally, however, we have in fact split one node in (a) into two nodes. In the higher-level model, (a), \\(Y\\) is a function of \\(X\\) and a disturbance \\(\\theta^Y\\), the latter representing all things other than \\(X\\) than can affect \\(Y\\). In our four-type setup, \\(\\theta^Y\\) represents all of the (unspecified) sources of variation in \\(X\\)’s effect on \\(Y\\). When we add \\(K\\), \\(X\\) now does not directly affect \\(Y\\) but only does so via \\(K\\). Further, we model \\(X\\) as acting on \\(K\\) “with error,” with \\(\\theta^K\\) representing all of the (unspecified) factors determining \\(X\\)’s effect on \\(K\\). The key thing to notice here is that \\(\\theta^K\\) now represents a portion of the variance that \\(\\theta^Y\\) represented in the higher-level graph: some of the variation in \\(X\\)’s effect on \\(Y\\) now arises from \\(X\\)’s effect on \\(K\\), which is captured by \\(\\theta^K\\). So, for instance, \\(X\\) might have no effect on \\(Y\\) because \\(\\theta^K\\) takes on a value such that \\(X\\) has no effect on \\(K\\). Likewise, any effect of \\(X\\) on \\(Y\\) must arise from an effect of \\(X\\) on \\(K\\), captured in \\(\\theta^K\\)’s value.3 What \\(\\theta^K\\) represents, then, is that part of the original \\(\\theta^Y\\) that arose from some force other than \\(X\\) operating at the first step of the causal chain from \\(X\\) to \\(Y\\). So now, \\(\\theta^Y\\) is not quite the same entity in the lower-level graph that it was in the higher-level graph. In the original graph, \\(\\theta^Y\\) represented all sources of variation in \\(X\\)’s effect on \\(Y\\). In the lower-level model, with \\(K\\) as mediator, \\(\\theta^Y\\) represents only random variation in \\(K\\)’s effect on \\(Y\\). \\(\\theta^Y\\) has been expunged of any factors shaping the first stage of the causal process, which now reside in \\(\\theta^K\\). Reflecting a convention that we use throughout the book, we highlight this change in \\(\\theta^Y\\)’s meaning by referring in the second model to \\(\\theta^{Y_\\text{lower}}\\). Theorization here thus starts with the proliferation of substantive variables—adding beliefs about intervening steps in a causal process. But, critically, it also involves an accompanying disaggregation of unexplained variation. Addition and splitting thus go hand-in-hand: the insertion of a mediator between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) also involves the splitting of \\(Y\\)’s unspecified parent (\\(\\theta_Y\\)). Consider next panel (c) in Figure , which also supports (implies) the higher-level theory in panel \\((a)\\). The logical relationship between models \\((a)\\) and \\((c)\\), however, is somewhat different. Here the lower-level model specifies one of the conditions that comprised \\(\\theta^Y\\) in the higher-level model. In specifying a moderator, \\(C\\), we have extracted \\(C\\) from \\(\\theta^Y\\), leaving \\(\\theta^{Y_\\text{lower}}\\) to represent all factors other than \\(C\\) that condition \\(X\\)’s effect on \\(Y\\). (Again, the relabeling as \\(\\theta^{Y_\\text{lower}}\\) reflects this change in the term’s meaning.) While we might add a \\(\\theta^C\\) term pointing into \\(C\\), this is not necessary. Whereas in Model (b) we have extracted \\(\\theta^K\\) from \\(\\theta^Y\\), in Model (c), it is \\(C\\) itself that we have extracted from \\(\\theta^Y\\), substantively specifying what had been just a srandom disturbance. 3.2.2 Generalizing a model A lower-level model, \\(M^\\prime\\), can also be a representation of \\(M\\) in which a node has been introduced that permits variation in a feature of context that is fixed and taken-for-granted in \\(M\\). Here, \\(M^\\prime\\) theorizes \\(M\\) in the sense of embedding \\(M\\) within a more general set of beliefs about how the world works. \\(M\\) then becomes a special case of the theorized relations, one that holds when we condition on some data, specifying some particularity of context. To illustrate this approach to theorization, consider again graphs (a) and (c) in Figure . We have discussed how the graph in panel (c) can represent a disaggregation of \\(\\theta^Y\\) from panel (a) into \\(\\theta^{Y_\\text{lower}}\\) and \\(C\\). An alternative possibility, however, is to employ a moderation model that represents a more general claim than the higher-level model that it supports. For instance, the graph in panel (a) might represent the causal function \\(Y=X+\\theta^Y\\). In this model, \\(X\\) always has an effect on \\(Y\\). The graph in panel (c), in turn, might represent the more general function, \\(Y=XC+\\theta^Y\\) (where \\(C\\) is binary). Now, whether \\(X\\) has an effect depends on the value of \\(C\\). In particular, model (c) combined with the observation \\(C=1\\) directly implies model (a). Model (a) is a special case of model (c) that holds in and only in the context \\(C=1\\). In answer to the question, “Why do you believe model (a)?” one could respond with model (c) plus the observation \\(C=1\\). Note the difference in how theorization has proceeded for the two moderation models (both graphically represented in panel (c)). When we introduce moderation via the disaggregation of nodes, we pull content out of \\(\\theta^Y\\) and specify it substantively. When we generalize, on the other hand, we add a node, a source of variation not factored into the original model at all. We can think of that variation as implicitly conditioned-on in the higher-level model. As a secondary matter, note that the \\(\\theta\\) term pointing into \\(Y\\) may or may not be altered by the addition. In particular, we will explore later, if \\(\\theta^Y\\) is a vessel for causal types, then the number of possible causal types—and, thus, \\(\\theta^Y\\)’s range—must expand as we add nodes pointing into \\(Y\\). But in the functions we have used in our illustration, \\(\\theta^{Y_\\text{lower}}\\) remains unchanged when we add the \\(C\\) node. In both the higher- and lower-level models, \\(\\theta^Y\\) represents precisely the same random disturbance. 3.3 Moving between higher- and lower-level models As we will see, thinking about models as conditionally nested within one another can be empirically useful. It provides a way of generating empirical leverage on a causal question by plumbing more deeply our background knowledge about a domain of interest. When we more fully specify higher-level claims via a more elaborate, lower-level model, we are a making explicit unspecified conditions on which the higher-level relationships depend. In doing this, we are identifying potentially observable nodes that might be informative about our research question. 3.3.1 Mappings are not one-to-one As we develop lower-level models to support our claims, or determine which claims are supported by our theories, what kinds of moves are we permitted to make? One important thing to note is that the mappings between higher-level claims and theories may not be one-to-one. A single theory can support multiple higher-level theories. Moreover, a single higher-level relation can be supported by multiple, possibly incompatible lower-level theories. To illustrate, consider two “lower level” theories of democratization: (\\(L_1\\)): \\(Inequality \\rightarrow Democratization \\leftarrow Mobilization\\) (\\(L_2\\)): \\(Inequality \\rightarrow Mobilization \\rightarrow Democratization\\) Note how these theories are incompatible with one another. While \\(Inequality\\) and \\(Democratization\\) are independent in \\(L_1\\), they are causally related in \\(L_2\\). Moreover, in \\(L_2\\), \\(Inequality\\) and \\(Democratization\\) are related only through \\(Mobilization\\), while in \\(L_1\\), \\(Democratization\\) is directly affected by \\(Inequality\\).4 Now, consider the following three higher-level claims: (\\(H_1\\)): \\(Inequality \\rightarrow Democratization\\) (\\(H_2\\)): \\(Mobilization \\rightarrow Democratization\\) (\\(H_3\\)): \\(Inequality \\rightarrow Mobilization\\) \\(H_1\\) could be derived from (explained by) either theory, \\(L_1\\) or \\(L_2\\). Although the two theories are incompatible with one another, in both theories \\(Inequality\\) affects \\(Democratization\\). Both theories likewise imply \\(H_2\\), in which \\(Mobilization\\) affects \\(Democratization\\). \\(H_3\\), however, can be supported only by one of these theories: only in \\(L_1\\), and not in \\(L_2\\), does \\(Inequality\\) cause \\(Mobilization\\).5 Thus multiple (possibly incompatible) theories can usually be proposed to explain any given causal effect. When seeking an explanation for, say, \\(H_1\\), the choice between \\(L_1\\) and \\(L_2\\) is not dictated by logic; it must be drawn from a substantive belief about which set of causal dependencies operates in the world. On the other hand, \\(L_2\\) is logically ruled out as an explanation of \\(H_3\\). Further, any given theory logically implies multiple (necessarily compatible) higher-level claims about causal relations. 3.3.2 Permissible moves across levels What, more generally, are the permissible moves across levels? 3.3.2.1 Moving down levels We have already discussed two possible forms of theorization — moves down a level: (i) disaggregating existing nodes, introducing beliefs about mediation or moderation, or (ii) adding nodes representing variation in a feature of context that is implicitly held constant in the higher-level model. There are other possible ways of elaborating a model. For instance, we can add antecedent conditions: causes of nodes that were exogenous in the higher-level model. Likewise, we can add downstream effects: outcomes of nodes that were terminal in the higher-level model. Figure 3.3: A higher-level model and a lower-level model that is impermissible. The central principle governing allowable elaborations is that a lower-level model must not introduce dependencies between variables that were omitted in the higher-level model. We provide an example of a violation of this principle in Figure 3.3. We start with a higher-level model, in panel (a), in which inequality affects democratization through mobilization. We then elaborate the model in panel (b) by adding ethnic homogeneity as a moderator of mobilization’s effect. However, because ethnic homogeneity is also modeled here as affecting inequality, we have now introduced a source of dependence between inequality and democratization that was omitted from the higher-level model. In panel (a), democratization and inequality were dependent only via mobilization; and so they are conditionally independent given mobilization. In panel (b), democratization and mobilization are additionally dependent via their common cause, ethnic homogeneity. By the rules governing causal graphs (see Chapter ), the higher-level specifically prohibited this second source of dependency—since all dependencies between variables must be represented. Put differently, if two variables are independent— or conditionally independent given a third variable—in one model, then this same relation of independence (or conditional independence) must be captured in any theory of that model. A theory can add conditional independencies not present in the higher-level model. For instance, a mediation theory, \\(X \\rightarrow M \\rightarrow Y\\), implies a conditional independence that is not present in the higher-level model that it supports, \\(X \\rightarrow Y\\): in the lower-level model only, \\(X\\) is conditionally independent of \\(Y\\) given \\(M\\). But we may not theorize away (conditional) independencies insisted on by our higher-level claim. 3.3.2.2 Moving up levels Moving in the other direction, what, in general, are the permissible simplifications of lower-level models? In other words, given a theory, what are the higher-level claims that it can support? When we move up a level — i.e., eliminate one or more nodes — the key rule is that the higher-level graph must take into account: all dependencies among remaining nodes and all variation generated by the eliminated node. We can work out what this means, separately, for eliminating endogenous nodes and for eliminating exogenous nodes. 3.3.2.2.1 Eliminating endogenous nodes Eliminating an endogenous nodes means removing a node with parents (direct causes) represented on the graph. If the node also has one or more children, then the node captures a dependency: it links its parents to its children. When we eliminate this node, preserving these dependencies requires that all of the eliminated node’s parents adopt—become parents of—all of the eliminated node’s children. Thus, for instance in panel (b) of Figure , if we were to eliminate \\(M\\), \\(M\\)’s parents (\\(X\\) and \\(\\theta^M\\)) need to adopt \\(M\\)’s child, \\(Y\\). We see in panel (a) of the figure, the higher-level model, that \\(X\\) is now pointing directly into \\(Y\\). As for \\(\\theta^M\\), it too must now point directly into \\(Y\\)—though we can use a bit of shorthand to make this happen. Recall that \\(\\theta^M\\) represents the part of \\(M\\) that is randomly determined. Rather than drawing two separate disturbance (\\(\\theta\\)) terms pointing into \\(Y\\), however, we more simply represent the combined disturbance term as \\(\\theta^Y_{\\text{higher}}\\), with the ‘’higher’’ signaling the aggregation of roots. (This is, of course, simply reversing the disaggregation that we undertook earlier to move from the higher- to the lower-level model.) More intuitively, when we simplify away a mediator, we need to make sure that we preserve the causal relationships being mediated—both those among substantive variables and any random shocks at the mediating causal steps.6 3.3.2.2.2 Eliminating exogenous nodes What about eliminating exogenous nodes—nodes with no parents? For the most part, exogenous nodes cannot be eliminated, but must either be replaced by or incorporated into \\(U\\) (or \\(\\theta\\)) terms. The reason is that we need preserve any dependencies or variation generated by the exogenous node. Figure 3.4 walks through four different situations in which we might want to simplify away the exogenous node, \\(X\\). (Here we use the more generic \\(U\\) notation, though the same principles apply if these are type-receptacles(\\(\\theta\\).) Figure 3.4: Here we represent the basic principles for eliminating exogenous nodes. Multiple children. In (a1), we start with a lower-level model in which \\(X\\) has two children, thus generating a dependency between \\(W\\) and \\(Y\\). If we eliminate \\(X\\), we must preserve this dependency. We can do so, as pictured in (a2), by replacing \\(X\\) with a \\(U\\) term that also points into \\(W\\) and \\(Y\\).7 Though we are no longer specifying what it is that connects \\(W\\) and \\(Y\\), the correlation itself is retained. Substantive spouse. In (b1), \\(X\\) has a spouse that is substantively specified, \\(W\\). If we eliminate \\(X\\), we have to preserve the fact that \\(Y\\) is not fully determined by \\(W\\); something else also generates variation in \\(Y\\). We thus need to replace \\(X\\) with a \\(U\\) term, \\(U_Y\\), to capture the variation in \\(Y\\) that is not accounted for by \\(W\\). \\(U\\)-term spouse. In (c1), \\(X\\) has a spouse that is not substantively specified, \\(U^{Y_\\text{lower}}\\). Eliminating \\(X\\) requires, again, capturing the variance that it generates as a random input. As we already have a \\(U\\) term pointing only into \\(Y\\), we can substitute in \\(U^{Y_\\text{higher}}\\), which represents both \\(U^{Y_\\text{lower}}\\) and the variance generated by \\(X\\).IS THIS FOOTNOTE RIGHT?8 One child, no spouse. In (d1), \\(X\\) has only one child and no spouse. Here we can safely eliminate \\(X\\) with no loss of information. It is always understood that every exogenous node has some cause, and there is no loss of information in simply eliminating a node’s causes if those causes are exogenous and do not affect other endogenous nodes in the model. In (d2) we are simply not specifying \\(Y\\)’s cause, but we have not lost any dependencies or sources of variance that had been expressed in (d1). One interesting effect of eliminating a substantive exogenous node can be to render seemingly deterministic relations effectively probabilistic. In moving from (b1) to (b2), we have taken a component of \\(Y\\) that was determined by \\(X\\) and converting it into a random disturbance. Just as we can explain a more probabilistic claim with a less probabilistic theory, we can derive higher-level claims with greater probabilism from theories with greater determinism. Figure 3.5: A lower-level model from which multiple higher level models can be derived. Figure 3.6: Higher level models derived from the lower level model of Figure X. Nodes that are eliminated are marked in grey; circles denote exogenous nodes that are replaced in subgraphs by unidentified variables. (A circled node pointing into two other nodes could equivalently be indicated as an undirected edge connecting the two.) Note that \\(M\\), \\(R\\), and \\(D\\) are deterministic functions of \\(I\\) and \\(E\\) in this example. We can apply these principles to a model of any complexity. We illustrate a wider range of simplifications by starting with Figure 3.5, which represents a somewhat amended version of our inequality and democratization model from Chapter 2, with more complex causal relations. Then, in Figure 3.6, we show all permissible reductions of the more elaborate model. We can think of these reductions as the full set of simpler claims (involving at least two nodes) that can be derived from the lower-level theory. In each subgraph, we mark eliminated nodes in grey; those nodes that are circled must be replaced with \\(U\\) terms; and arrows represent the causal dependencies that must be preserved. Note, for instance, that neither \\(E\\) (because it has a spouse) nor \\(I\\) (because it has multiple children) can be simply eliminated; each must be replaced with a \\(U\\) term. Also, the higher-level graph with nodes missing can contain arrows that do not appear at all in the lower-level graph: eliminating \\(M\\), for instance, forces an arrow running from \\(X\\) to \\(R\\) and another running from \\(X\\) to \\(Y\\), as \\(X\\) must adopt \\(M\\)’s children. The simplest elimination is of \\(D\\) itself since it does not encode any dependencies between other variables. We can also read Figure 3.6 as telling us the set of claims for which the lower-level graph in Figure can serve as a theory. As we can see, the range of claims that a moderately complex model can theorize is vast. For each simpler claim, moreover, there may be other possible lower-level graphs—theories besides —consistent with it. 3.3.2.2.3 Conditioning on nodes A further permissible “upward” move is conditioning on a node. When we condition on a node, we are restricting the higher-level model in scope to situations in which that node’s value is held constant. Doing so allows us to eliminate the node as well as all arrows pointing into it or out of it. Consider three different situations in which we might condition on a node: Exogneous, with multiple children. In simplifying (a1) in Figure 3.4, we need to be sure we retain any dependence that \\(X\\) generates between \\(W\\) and \\(Y\\). However, recalling the rules of conditional independence on a graph (see Chapter ), we know that \\(W\\) and \\(Y\\) are independent conditional on \\(X\\). Put differently, if we restrict the analysis to contexts in which \\(X\\) takes on a constant value, the lower-level model implies that \\(Y\\) and \\(W\\) will be uncorrelated across cases. As fixing \\(X\\)’s value breaks the dependence between \\(Y\\) and \\(W\\), we can drop \\(X\\) (and the arrows pointing out of it) without having to represent that dependence. Exogenous, with spouse. In simplifying (b1) or (c1) Figure 3.4, we need to account for the variation generated by \\(X\\). If we fix \\(X\\)’s value, however, then we eliminate this variation by assumption and do not need to continue to represent it (or the arrow pointing out of it) on the graph. Endogenous. When we condition on an endogenous node, we can eliminate the node as well the arrows pointing into and out of it. We, again, leverage relations of conditional independence here. If we start with graph (b) in Figure , and we condition on the mediator, \\(M\\), we sever the link between \\(Y\\) on \\(X\\), rendering them conditionally independent of one another. We can thus remove \\(M\\), the arrow from \\(X\\) to \\(M\\), and the arrow from \\(M\\) to \\(Y\\). In the new model, with \\(M\\) fixed, \\(Y\\) will be entirely determined by the random disturbance \\(\\theta^{Y_\\text{lower}}\\).9 In sum, we can work with models that are simpler than our causal beliefs: we may believe a complex lower-level model to be true, but we can derive from it a sparer set of claims. There may be intervening causal steps or features of context that we believe matter, but that are not of interest for a particular line of inquiry. While these can be removed, we nonetheless have to make sure that their implications for the relations remaining in the model are not lost. Understanding the rules of reduction allow us to undertake an important task: checking which simpler claims are and are not consistent with our full belief set. BOXES BOX 1 Two kinds of theories. Theories are “lower-level” causal models that explain or provide an account of a “higher-level”, simpler model. There are two forms of theorization: The disaggregation of nodes. A single node in a higher-level model can be split into multiple nodes. For instance, for a higher-level model in which \\(X \\rightarrow Y \\leftarrow \\theta^Y\\): Mediation: A mediator, \\(M\\), can be introduced between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), thus splitting \\(\\theta^Y\\) into \\(\\theta^M\\) and \\(\\theta^{Y_\\text{lower}}\\). The mediation theory thus explains the \\(X \\rightarrow Y\\) relationship. Moderation: A component of \\(\\theta^Y\\) can be extracted and specified as a substantive variable. This variable is now a substantively conceptualized moderator of the \\(X \\rightarrow Y\\) relationship. The moderation theory thus provides a fuller explanation of why \\(X\\) has different effects on \\(Y\\) in different contexts. Generalization. A feature of context omitted and implicitly held constant in a higher-level model can be explicitly included in the model. The higher-level model is now explained as a special case of a more general set of causal relations. BOX 2 Rules for moving between levels Moving down levels: All (conditional) independencies represented in a higher-level model must be preserved in the lower-level model. When we disaggregate or add nodes to a model, new conditional independencies can be generated. But any variables that are independent or conditionally independent (given a third variable) in the higher-level model must also be independent or conditionally independent in the lower-level model. Moving up levels: We can move up levels by eliminating an exogenous node, eliminating an endogenous node, or conditioning on a node. When we eliminate a node from a model, we must preserve any variation and dependencies that it generates: When eliminating an endogenous node, that node’s parents adopt (become direct causes of) that node’s children. When eliminating an exogenous node, we must usually replace it with a \\(U\\) term. If the node has more than one child, it must be replaced with a \\(U\\) term pointing into both children (or an undirected edge connecting them) to preserve the dependency between its children. If the node has a spouse, the eliminated node’s variation must also be preserved using a \\(U\\) term. Where the spouse is (already) a \\(U\\) term with no other children, \\(U\\) terms can be combined. Since conditioning on a node “blocks” the path through which it connects its children, we can simply eliminate the node and the arrows between it and its children. An exogenous node with no spouse and only one child can be simply eliminated. 3.4 Beneath the Graph: Causal Types in Lower-Level Models We have discussed theorization largely from a graphical perspective, showing how features of causal graphs change (nodes get split, combined, added, or removed) as we move down or up levels. But there is more that happens beneath the surface of a graphical structure when we theorize a claim. In this section, we return to our causal-type framework, in which causal types are captured by \\(\\theta\\) terms. While we have already shown how we can introduce causal types into the simplest \\(X \\rightarrow Y\\) model, we work through here how the causal-type space changes as we complicate that model. We show, first, how causal types operate a mediation model, and then how they operate in a model with moderation. 3.4.1 Mediation as Theory We begin with a simple claim: there are two binary variables, \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), and \\(X\\) may have an effect on \\(Y\\). This claim is represented in Figure (a) above. In this graph, \\(X\\) is independent of \\(\\theta^Y\\), which means that it is as if \\(X\\) is randomly assigned. We will let \\(\\theta^Y\\) be a variable that ranges across our four different causal types, conditioning how \\(Y\\) responds to \\(X\\). While \\(a, b, c\\), and \\(d\\) were heuristically useful as a way of introducing the idea of a causal type, things will soon get more complicated, so it will be useful to have more flexible notation. Going forward, we will usually refer to causal types using \\(\\theta\\) notation, with subscripts and superscripts used to denote potential outcomes and outcome variables. In our binary \\(X \\rightarrow Y\\) setup, we can indicate the causal type governing \\(Y\\)’s response with notation of the form \\(\\theta^Y_{ij}\\), where \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) represent \\(Y\\)’s potential outcomes. Specifically, \\(i\\) represents the value \\(Y\\) takes on when \\(X=0\\), while \\(j\\) represents the value \\(Y\\) takes on when \\(X=1\\).10 Thus, the translation from \\(a, b, c\\) and \\(d\\) notation is: a: \\(\\theta_{10}^Y\\). A negative effect implies that \\(Y\\) is \\(1\\) when \\(X=0\\) and \\(0\\) when \\(X=1\\). b: \\(\\theta_{01}^Y\\). A positive effect implies that \\(Y\\) is \\(0\\) when \\(X=0\\) and \\(1\\) when \\(X=1\\). c: \\(\\theta_{00}^Y\\). A null “chronic” effect implies that \\(Y\\) is \\(0\\) regardless of \\(X\\)’s value. d: \\(\\theta_{11}^Y\\). A null “destined” effect implies that \\(Y\\) is \\(1\\) regardless of \\(X\\)’s value. To be clear, these \\(\\theta_{ij}^Y\\) terms are not random variables; they are the four values (types) that the type-variable \\(\\theta^Y\\) can take on. Now consider a theory that specifies a variable intervening between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\). This theory is depicted in Figure (b) above, where \\(M\\) mediates the relationship. We see that there are now two \\(\\theta\\) terms, each representing a set of causal types for a different step in the causal chain. While \\(\\theta^Y\\) represented \\(Y\\)’s response to its parent \\(X\\), \\(\\theta^Y_{\\text{lower}}\\) represents \\(Y\\)’s response to its “new” parent, \\(M\\). We now also need to conceive of a causal type capturing \\(M\\)’s response to \\(X\\), and we let \\(\\theta^M\\) represent this type.11 We thus allow \\(X\\) to have a positive, negative, or no effect on \\(M\\), with \\(\\theta^M\\) taking on four possible values: a: \\(\\theta_{10}^M\\) b: \\(\\theta_{01}^M\\) c: \\(\\theta_{00}^M\\) d: \\(\\theta_{11}^M\\) And we allow for \\(M\\) to have a positive, negative, or no effect on \\(Y\\), with \\(\\theta^Y_{\\text{lower}}\\)’s possible values being: a: \\(\\theta_{10}^Y\\) b: \\(\\theta_{01}^Y\\) c: \\(\\theta_{00}^Y\\) d: \\(\\theta_{11}^Y\\) We can now think about combinations of types in the lower-level model as mapping onto types in the higher-level model. We work through these mappings in greater detail later in the book, but consulting table 3.1, one can readily see how this works. Table 3.1: Mapping from lower level nodal types on \\(M\\) and \\(Y\\) to higher level causal types on \\(Y\\). \\(\\theta_{10}^{Y_{lower}}\\) \\(\\theta_{01}^{Y_{lower}}\\) \\(\\theta_{00}^{Y_{lower}}\\) \\(\\theta_{11}^{Y_{lower}}\\) \\(\\theta_{10}^{M}\\) \\(\\theta_{01}^{Y_{higher}}\\) \\(\\theta_{10}^{Y_{higher}}\\) \\(\\theta_{00}^{Y_{higher}}\\) \\(\\theta_{11}^{Y_{higher}}\\) \\(\\theta_{01}^{M}\\) \\(\\theta_{10}^{Y_{higher}}\\) \\(\\theta_{01}^{Y_{higher}}\\) \\(\\theta_{00}^{Y_{higher}}\\) \\(\\theta_{11}^{Y_{higher}}\\) \\(\\theta_{00}^{M}\\) \\(\\theta_{11}^{Y_{higher}}\\) \\(\\theta_{00}^{Y_{higher}}\\) \\(\\theta_{00}^{Y_{higher}}\\) \\(\\theta_{11}^{Y_{higher}}\\) \\(\\theta_{11}^{M}\\) \\(\\theta_{00}^{Y_{higher}}\\) \\(\\theta_{11}^{Y_{higher}}\\) \\(\\theta_{00}^{Y_{higher}}\\) \\(\\theta_{11}^{Y_{higher}}\\) For instance, in a case in which both \\(\\theta^M=\\theta^M_{01}\\) (a positive effect of \\(X\\) on \\(M\\)) and \\(\\theta^{Y_{\\text{lower}}}=\\theta_{01}^{Y_{lower}}\\) (a positive effect of \\(M\\) on \\(Y\\)), we have a positive effect of \\(X\\) on \\(Y\\)—meaning that, in the higher-level model, \\(\\theta^{Y_{higher}}=\\theta^{Y_{higher}}_{01}\\). Two linked negative effects also generate a positive effect of \\(X\\) on \\(Y\\) and so map onto the same higher-level type. Further, it is easy to see that if there is no causal effect at either the \\(X \\rightarrow M\\) step or the \\(M \\rightarrow Y\\) step, we will have one of the null effect types at the higher level since, in this model, \\(X\\) cannot affect \\(Y\\) unless there are causal effects at both constituent steps.12 To foreshadow the discussion in later chapters, these mappings are critical: they allow us to use inferences drawn at a lower level to answer questions posed at a higher level. 3.4.2 Moderation as Theory Now consider an alternative lower-level theory, represented in Figure (c) above. Here \\(C\\) is posited as a second parent of \\(Y\\). This graph contains the substantive assumptions that \\(C\\)’s value is determined independently of \\(X\\)’s, as well as the assumption that \\(X\\) and \\(C\\) are both as-if randomly assigned. In this graph, we again have a \\(\\theta_Y^{\\text{lower}}\\) term, but it is a different object from \\(\\theta_Y^{\\text{lower}}\\) in the mediation graph. In this moderation model, \\(\\theta_Y^{\\text{lower}}\\) is more complex as it determines the mapping from two binary variables into \\(Y\\). A causal type in this setup now represents how a case will respond to four different possible combintations of \\(X\\) and \\(C\\) values. Rather than four causal types, we now have 16, as there are 16 possible ways in which a case might respond to two binary variables. Table {#tab:PO16} in Chapter provides a tabular representation of the complete set of 16 potential outcomes. However, we can also represent these types more compactly. For a setup with two binary causes, we will use the notation \\(\\theta_{ij}^{gh}\\). The subscripts and superscripts represent \\(Y\\)’s potential outcomes for different values of \\(X\\) and \\(C\\). To aid interpretation, we always place \\(X\\) on the horizontal axis and a second variable (here, \\(C\\)) on the vertical access. In other words, the value of \\(X\\) increases from 0 to 1 as we move to the right, from \\(i\\) to \\(j\\) or from \\(g\\) to \\(h\\). And the value of \\(C\\) increases from 0 to 1 as we move up, from \\(i\\) to \\(g\\) or from \\(j\\) to \\(h\\). \\(\\theta_{ij}^{gh}\\) thus denotes a unit that has outcome \\(i\\) when \\(X=0, C=0\\), \\(j\\) when \\(X=1, C=0\\), \\(g\\) when \\(X=0, C=1\\), \\(h\\) when \\(X=1, C=1\\). To illustrate, \\(\\theta_Y^{\\text{lower}}=\\): \\(\\theta_{00}^{11}\\) means that \\(X\\) has no effect under any value of \\(C\\), and \\(C\\) has a positive effect under any value of \\(X\\). \\(\\theta_{10}^{10}\\) implies that \\(X\\) always has a negative effect, and \\(C\\) never has an effect. \\(\\theta_{01}^{11}\\) represents one kind of conditional effect: \\(X\\) has a positive effect only when \\(C=0\\), and \\(C\\) has a positive effect only when \\(X=0\\). Again, we can map between lower- and higher-level types—though we may need to do so in combination with data. For instance, a case has type \\(\\theta_{01}\\) in the higher-level model if it has type \\(\\theta_{01}^{11}\\) in the lower-level model and \\(C=0\\). This is a case for which \\(X\\) has a positive effect on \\(Y\\) when \\(C=0\\) and in which \\(C\\) is in fact 0. On the other hand, the same lower level type, \\(\\theta_{01}^{11}\\), in combination with \\(C=1\\) maps onto the type \\(\\theta_{11}\\) in the higher-level model—a type in which \\(Y\\) is 1 regardless of \\(X\\)’s value. Meanwhile, the lower-level type \\(\\theta_{10}^{10}\\) maps onto the higher-level type \\(\\theta_{10}\\) regardless of the data (\\(C\\)’s value) since this lower-level type implies that \\(X\\) has a negative effect on \\(Y\\) under any value of \\(C\\). In later chapters, we represent all lower- to higher-level mappings relevant to a question of interest with the use of “type-reduction” tables that allow one to readily see how inferences drawn at one level inform causal questions posed at another level. 3.5 Conclusion Before moving on, it is worth considering how the understanding of theory that we work with in this book compares to other prominent understandings of theory. Theory as tautology. The claim that the number of Nash equilibria is generically odd in finite games is often understood to be a theoretical claim. Unless there are errors in the derivation of the result, the claim is true in the sense that the conclusions follow from the assumptions. There is no evidence that we could go looking for in the world to assess the claim. The same can be said of the theoretical claims of many formal models in social sciences; they are theoretical deductions of the if-then variety (Clarke and Primo 2012). Theory in this sense is true by tautology. By contrast, theory as we define it in this book refers to claims with empirical content: a theory refers to causal relations in the world that might or might not hold, and is susceptible to empirical testing. The deductive logical relations that hold in a causal model are those of conditional independence, as discussed in Chapter 2: for instance, if \\(X\\) causes \\(Y\\) only through \\(M\\) in a theory, then \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are conditionally independent given some value of \\(M\\). Theory as a collection of maps. According to Clarke and Primo (2012), building on a semantic view of theory (Giere (2010)), a theory is a collection of models, together with a set of hypotheses linking them to the real world. As in our usage, Clarke and Primo see theories and models as very similar objects: for them, a theory is a system of models; for us, a theory is a supporting model. In both frameworks, there is no real difference in kind between models and theories. Our approach also shares with Clarke and Primo the idea that models are not full and faithful reflections of reality; they are maps designed for a particular purpose. In the case of causal models, the purpose is to capture relationships of independence and possible causal dependence. As we have shown, that is a purpose that allows for the stripping away of detail—though it also forbids certain simplifications (such as any simplification that removes a dependency between variables). Clarke and Primo see models as useful to the extent that they are similar to features of the real world in ways related to the model’s purpose. Along these lines, a causal model will be useful to the extent that it posits relations of independence that are similar to those prevailing in the domain under investigation. Theory as a testable claim In the hypothetico-deductive framework, often traced back to Popper (2002) and highly influential in empirical political science, empirical social science is an activity of theory-testing. Having developed a theory, we then derive from it a set of empirical predictions and then test those predictions against evidence. In Clarke and Primo (2012), we also seek to confirm theories by developing and testing hypotheses about the similarity of a model or theory to particular features of the world. In both cases, a theory is posited—possibly on the basis of logic or background knowledge—and then assessed. The value (truth or usefulness) of the model itself is the object of inquiry. In a causal-model framework, theories are always tentative, and we can subject any model or theory to empirical evaluation, a task to which we turn in Chapter 14. However, in the book’s setup, theories are first and foremost expressions of what we already know and don’t know about a given causal domain when inquiry begins. We encode this background knowledge in order to inform research-design choices and draw inferences from the data. Models and theories are thus, in this sense, the world within which inquiry unfolds. Indeed, as we explore in Chapter 4, the very questions we ask live within—can be represented as parts of—our theories. Theory as generalization In another of the many uses of “theory,” political scientists often think of theorization as generalization. For Van Evera (1997) and Przeworski and Teune (1970), for instance, theories are by their nature general statements that we can use to explain specific events. In this view, “Diamond resources caused Sierra Leone’s civil war” is a case-specific explanation; “Natural resource endowments cause civil war” is a theoretical formulation. In our treatment of theory as a lower-level causal model, however, there is no generic sense in which a theory is more or less general than the higher-level claim that it explains. In this book’s framework, we can theorize by generalizing: when we elaborate a model by building in variation in a factor that was held constant in the higher-level claim, we are making the model more general in scope. If our natural resources claim implicitly applies only to weak states, we can theorize this claim by allowing state strength to vary and articulating how the natural-resource effect hinges on that claim. However, when we theorize by disaggregating nodes—say, by adding intervening causal steps—we have in fact made a more specific claim. Natural resources may cause civil war under a broad set of circumstances. Natural resources will cause civil war through looting by rebel groups under an almost certainly narrower set of circumstances. Here, the more elaborate argument—the theorization of why \\(X\\) causes \\(Y\\)—is actually a stronger claim, with narrower scope, than the simpler one that it supports. The value of parsimony Van Evera (1997) and Przeworski and Teune (1970) also express a common view in characterizing parsimony as a quality of good theory. While they recognize that parsimony must often be traded off against other goods, such as accuracy and generality, ceteris paribus a more parsimonious theory—one that uses fewer causal variables to explain variation in a given outcome—is commonly understood to be a better theory. We do not take issue with the idea that simpler models and explanations are, all else equal, better. But the succeeding chapters also demonstrate a distinctive and important way in which all else will often not be equal when we seek to use theory to guide research design and support causal inference. To foreshadow the argument to come, the elaboration of more detailed, lower-level models can direct us to new opportunities for learning. As we unpack a higher-level claim, we will often be identifying additional features of a phenomenon the observation of which can shed light on causal questions of interest. Moreover, our background beliefs—the prior knowledge on which causal inference must usually rest—are often more informative at lower levels than at higher levels: it will, for instance, often be easier for us express beliefs about causal effects for smaller steps along a causal chain than about an overarching \\(X \\rightarrow Y\\) effect. Making things more complicated, of course, still makes things more complicated. And we should avoid doing so when the payoff is small, as it will sometimes be. But in the pages to come, we will also see a distinct set of benefits that arise from drilling more deeply into our basis of prior knowledge when formulating inferential strategies. 3.6 Appendix: Illustration of a Mapping from a Game to a DAG Our running example supports a set of higher level models, but it can also be implied by a lower level models. Here we illustrate with an example in which the lower level model is a game theoretic model, together with a solution.13 In Figure we show a game in which nature first decides on the type of the media and the politician – is it a media that values reporting on corruption or not? Is the politician one who has a dominant strategy to engage in corruption or one who is sensitive to the risks of media exposure? In the example the payoffs to all players are fully specified, though for illustration we include parameter \\(b\\) in the voter’s payoffs which captures utility gains from sacking a politician that has had a negative story written about them whether or not they actually engaged in corruption. A somewhat less specific, though more easily defended, theory would not specify particular numbers as in the figure, but rather assume ranges on payoffs that have the same strategic implications. The theory is then the game plus a solution to the game. Here for a solution the theory specifies subgame perfect equilibrium. In the subgame perfect equilibrium of the game; marked out on the game tree (for the case \\(b=0\\)) the sensitive politicians do not engage in corruption when there is a free press – otherwise they do; a free press writes up any acts of corruption, voters throw out the politician if indeed she is corrupt and this corruption is reported by the press. As with any structural model, the theory says what will happen but also what would happen if things that should not happen happen. Figure 3.7: A Game Tree. Solid lines represent choices on the (unique) equilibrium path of the subgames starting after nature’s move for the case in which \\(b=0\\). To draw this equilibrium as a DAG we include nodes for every action taken, nodes for features that determine the game being played, and the utilities at the end of the game. If equilibrium claims are justified by claims about the beliefs of actors then these could also appear as nodes. To be clear however these are not required to represent the game or the equilibrium, though they can capture assumed logics underlying the equilibrium choice. For instance a theorist might claim that humans are wired so that whenever they are playing a “Stag Hunt” game they play “defect.” The game and this solution can be represented on a DAG without reference to the beliefs of actors about the action of other players. However, if the justification for the equilibrium involves optimization given the beliefs of other players, a lower level DAG could represent this by having a node for the game description that points to beliefs about the actions of others, that then points to choices. In a game with dominant strategies, in contrast, there would be no arrows from these beliefs to actions. For our running example, nodes could usefully include the politician’s expectations, since the government’s actions depend on expectations of the actions of others. However, given the game there is no gain from including the media’s expectations of the voter’s actions since in this case the media’s actions do not depend on expectations of the voters actions then these expectations should be included. In Figure we provide two examples of DAGs that illustrate lower level models that support our running example. The upper graph gives a DAG reflecting equilibrium play in the game described in Figure . Note that in this game there is an arrow between \\(C\\) and \\(Y\\) even though \\(Y\\) does not depend on \\(C\\) for some values of \\(b\\)—this is because conditional independence requires that two variables are independent for all values of the conditioning set. For simplicity also we mark \\(S\\) and \\(X\\), along with \\(b\\) as features that affect which subgame is being played—taking the subgames starting after Nature’s move. Note that the government’s expectations of responses by others matters, but the expectations of other players do not matter given this game and solution. Note that the utilities appear twice in a sense. They appear in the subgame node, as they are part of the definition of the game–though here they are the utilities that players expect at each terminal node; when they appear at the end of the DAG they are the utilities that actually arise (in theory at least). The lower level DAG is very low and much more general, representing the theory that in three player games of complete information, players engage in backwards induction and choose the actions that they expect to maximize utility given their beliefs about the actions of others. The DAG assumes that players know what game is being played (“Game”), though this could also be included for more fundamental justification of behavioral predictions. Each action is taken as a function of the beliefs about the game, the expectations about the actions of others, and knowledge of play to date. The functional equations—not shown—are given by optimization and belief formation assuming optimization by others. Figure 3.8: The upper panel shows a causal graph that describes relations between nodes suggested by analysis of the game in Figure and which can imply the causal graph of Figure . The game itself (or beliefs about the game) appear as a node, which are in turn determined by exogneous factors. The lower panel represents a still lower level and more general theory ``players use backwards induction in three step games of complete information.’’ These lower level graphs can themselves provide clues for assessing relations in the higher level graphs. For instance, the lower level model might specify that the value of \\(b\\) in the game affects the actions of the government only through their beliefs about the behavior of voters, \\(E\\). These beliefs may themselves have a stochastic component, \\(U_E\\). Thus \\(b\\) high might be thought to reduce the effect of media on corruption. For instance if \\(b \\in \\mathbb{R}_+\\), we have \\(C= 1-FG(1-\\mathbb{1}(b&gt;1))\\). If \\(X\\) is unobserved and one is interested in whether \\(S=0\\) caused corruption, knowledge of \\(b\\) is informative. It is a root node in the causal estimand. If \\(b&gt;1\\) then \\(S=0\\) did not cause corruption. However if \\(b\\) matters only because of its effect on \\(E\\) then the query depends on \\(U_E\\). In this case, while knowing \\(b\\) is informative about whether \\(S=0\\) caused \\(C=1\\), knowing \\(E\\) from the lower level graph is more informative. Note that the model we have examined here involves no terms for \\(U_C\\), \\(U_R\\) and \\(U_Y\\)—that is, shocks to outcomes given action. Yet clearly any of these could exist. One could imagine a version of this game with “trembling hands,” such that errors are always made with some small probability, giving rise to a much richer set of predictions. These can be represented in the game tree as moves by nature between actions chosen and outcomes realized. Importantly in a strategic environment such noise could give rise to different types of conditional independence. For instance say that a Free Press only published its report on corruption with probability \\(\\pi^R\\), then with \\(\\pi^R\\) high enough the sensitive government might decide it is worth engaging in corruption even if there is a free press; in this case the arrow from \\(X\\) to \\(C\\) would be removed. Interestingly in this case as the error rate rises, \\(R\\) becomes less likely, meaning that the effect of a \\(S\\) on \\(Y\\) becomes gradually weaker (since governments that are not sensitive become more likely to survive) and then drops to 0 as sensitive governments start acting just like nonsensitive governments.
