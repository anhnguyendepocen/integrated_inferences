We now return to the inequality and democracy application but with a mixture of extensive and intensive data strategies: a combination of \\(I\\) and \\(D\\) data on a large number of cases together with mobilization data on a subset of those cases. We then use the updated model to draw both population-level and case-level inferences. We also complicate the model by allowing for the possibility that inequality is endogenous by building in unobserved confounding. The critical difference between the analyses in this chapter and those in Chapter 9 is that, here, we update our beliefs over the population parameters, and not just over effects within the case. Thus, we can now simultaneously learn about our theory from cases and use our updated theory to draw case-level inferences. In other words, while our process tracing was entirely theory-informed, mixed-data inference is also data-informed. As we will see, the data-informed inferences are, on the whole, more uncertain than the theory-based inferences of Chapter 7. 11.1 A trained model Whereas in Chapter 9 we took the model as given and sought to draw inferences individual cases given data on those cases, the model now becomes an object that we both learn from and learn about. In essence we use the data on many cases to update our beliefs about the general model and then use this trained model to make inferences about cases. Along with this change in goals come some changes in the structure of the model: Instead of positing a belief about the causal type of a given case, \\(\\theta\\), we now need to posit a belief over the distribution of nodal typesthat is, over \\(\\lambda\\). For instance, whereas in the simple process-tracing model we specified that inequality has a positive effect on mobilization for some share of units, we now specify a distribution over the proportion of units for which inequality could have a positive effect, ranging anywhere from 0 to 1. And we do the same for all other nodal types, with the proportions across types constrained to add up to 1  and, of course, for all nodes. Because we set a prior distribution over nodal types (rather than fixed proportions), we can now update on these population-level distributions as the model confronts data. The same applies to beliefs about confounding. Recall that we allow for unobserved confounding by allowing \\(\\lambda\\) to include beliefs about the joint distributions of nodal types, and we set priors on these joint distributions as well. In the application below, we focus on potential confounding in the relationship between inequality and mobilization: the possibility that inequality may be more or less likely in places where inequality would induce mobilization. Here we do not express informed prior beliefs about the direction or magnitude of such confounding; we set up the parameter matrix to allow for the possibility of confounding and set a flat prior over its direction and magnitude. We can, in turn, learn about confounding from the data. We begin with the same basic model as we used in Chapter 9, with inequality (\\(I\\)) potentially affecting democratization (\\(D\\)) both through a direct pathway and through an indirect pathway mediated by mobilization (\\(M\\)). International pressure (\\(P\\)) is also a parent of democratization. Further, we impose the same set of qualitative restrictions, ruling out a negative effect of inequality on mobilization, a direct positive effect of inequality on democratization, a negative effect of mobilization on democracy, and a negative effect of pressure on democratization. Note that this setup allows for inequality to have a positive (through mobilization) effect on democratization, a negative (direct) effect on democratization, or no effect at all. Finally, we allow for confounding. The theoretical intuition we want to instantiate in the model is that the level of inequality could be endogenous to inequalitys effect on mobilization. In particular, in places where mobilization would pose a mobilizational threat, governments may work harder to reduce inequality. To allow for this possibility, we need to create distinct elements of \\(\\lambda\\) representing the conditional distribution of \\(I\\)s nodal types given \\(M\\)s: one parameter for \\(\\theta^I\\)s distribution when \\(M\\)s nodal type is \\(\\theta^M_{01}\\), and another parameter for \\(\\theta^I\\)s distribution when \\(M\\)s nodal type is something else. This model, with confounding, is represented graphically as in Figure 11.1. The possibility of confounding is represented with the bidirected edge, connecting \\(I\\) and \\(M\\). Figure 11.1: Democracy and Inequality Model 11.2 Data As in Chapter 9, we will confront the model with data drawn from coding narratives in the Supplementary Material for Haggard and Kaufman (2012). However, rather than implementing the analysis case-by-case, we now derive leverage from the joint distribution of the data available across all cases. Table 11.1 gives a snapshot of the data. Table 11.1: Data (snapshot) derived from Haggard and Kaufman (2012) Case P I M D Afghanistan 1 0 Albania 0 0 1 1 Algeria 0 0 Angola 1 0 Argentina 0 0 1 1 Bangladesh 0 0 0 1 Note that this is not a rectangular dataset in that Haggard and Kaufmans collection of clues was conditional on the outcome, \\(D=1\\): they gathered qualitative data on the presence of international pressure and the presence of mass-mobilization only for those cases that democratized. This is not an uncommon case-selection principle. The analyst often reasons that more can be learned about how an outcome arises by focusing in on cases where the outcome of interest has in fact occurred. (We assess this case-selection intuition, in the context of model-based inferences, in Chapter 15.) The raw correlations between variables is shown in Table ??. Some correlations are missing because, as mentioned, data on some variables were only gathered conditional on the values of others. For those quantities where we do see correlations, they are not especially strong. There is, in particular, a weak overall relationship between inequality and democratization  though, of course, this is consistent with inequality having heterogeneous effects across the sample. The strongest correlation in the data is between \\(P\\) and \\(M\\), which are assumed to be uncorrelated in the model, though this correlation is also quite weak.

The code below shows how to defeine the Democratization model in CausalQueries. The first line provides the DAG and indicated confounding between I and M. The second line imposes monotonicity restrictions. model &lt;- make_model(&quot;I -&gt; M -&gt; D &lt;- P; I -&gt; D; I &lt;-&gt; M&quot;) %&gt;% set_restrictions(c( &quot;(M[I=1] &lt; M[I=0])&quot;, &quot;(D[I=1] &gt; D[I=0]) | (D[M=1] &lt; D[M=0]) | (D[P=1] &lt; D[P=0])&quot;)) We can then figure out the set of parameters needed to characterize all possible causal relations between these nodes that are consistent with the model. These parameters are used to specify a likelihood function, which, combined with priors on parameters and the data lets us update on the dsitribution of causal relations. In CausalQueries all this is done using update_model(). model &lt;- update_model(model, data) What do we find? 11.3.1 Did inequality cause democracy? We have used the data to update on \\(\\lambda\\): our beliefs about the distributions of nodal types, including about their joint distributions (i.e., confounding). One set of questions we can ask of the updated model is about the probability that high inequality causes democratization. We can pose this question at different levels of conditioning. For instance, we can ask: For all cases. For what proportion of cases in the population does inequality have a positive effect on democratization? For all cases displaying a given causal state and outcome. Looking specifically at those cases that in fact had high inequality and democratized, for what proportion was the high inequality a cause of democratization? For cases displaying a given causal state and outcome, and with additional clues present or absent. What if we have also collected clues on mediating or moderating nodes? For instance, for what proportion of high-inequality, democratizing cases with mobilization did inequality cause the outcome? For what proportion without mobilization? Likewise for the presence or absence of international pressure? We ask CausalQueries now to query \\(\\lambda\\)s posterior distribution to generate posterior distributions for each of these quantities. We can define our queries quite simply in terms of the causal types that correspond to the effect of interest and then take the conditional probability of these. We present the code and results of these operations below and in Figure 11.2. In figure @(fig:pimdqueries) we graph the priors for each of these queries next to the posteriors. ## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`. ## Warning: Removed 12 rows containing missing values (geom_bar).

The proportion is considerably higher for those cases that in fact experienced high inequality and democratization. The proportion of positive causal effects is believed to be even higher for those in which mobilization occurred, especially where an alternative causesinternational pressurewas absent, though our uncertainty about this share is also very high. We also see that the absence of mobilization tells us for certain that democratization was not caused by inequality. Interestingly, however, this result derives from the model restrictions, rather than from the data: under the restrictions we imposed, a positive effect of inequality could operate only through mobilization. 11.3.2 Did inequality prevent democracy? We can undertake the same exercise for a negative causal effect, generating estimates a comparable set of estimands, as shown in Figure 11.3. ## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`. ## Warning: Removed 12 rows containing missing values (geom_bar). Figure 11.3: Posteriors on Causes of Democratization ``` We see that inequality appears, overall, more commonly to prevent democratization than to cause it. We are, moreover, most confident that inequality played a preventative role in those cases in which there was mobilization and international pressureboth of which could have generated democratizationbut still no democratization occurred. Importantly, in the mixed-data setting, we can think of our estimands in both population-level and case-level terms. We have initialy posed these question as population-level queries. The results in Figures 11.2 and 11.3 can be understood as our estimates of the share of cases in the population, with a given set of characteristics, for which a particular causal effect holds. Yet these distributions, by the very same token, represent our beliefs about the probability that \\(I\\) had a positive causal effect in an individual case. Thus, for instance, from Figure 11.2 we can see the posterior on the proportion of \\(I=D=M=1\\) cases in the population for which \\(I=1\\) caused \\(D=1\\). But this also tells us, for an individual case randomly selected from the population of \\(I=D=M=1\\) cases, the probability that high inequality caused democratization in the case. The key difference from the pure process-tracing setup is that here our case-level inferences are informed by data from the population, rather than population-level beliefs serving only as priors.

The error bars show plus or minus one standard deviation of the posterior variance. Figure 11.5: Posteriors on the probability that inequality prevented democratization (probability that I has a negative effect on D given observed case level data. The error bars show plus or minus one standard deviation of the posterior variance. ) The error bars show plus or minus one standard deviation of the posterior variance. We see that uncertainty is large and that the updating on probative value is small relative to mean inferneces.
