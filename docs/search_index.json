Lower level models serve as a theory for a higher level model if the higher level model can be deduced from the lower level model. The empirical content of a lower level model is the possible reduction in variance of the higher level model that it can provide. Theory plays an important role in this books use of causal models for causal inference. Yet the term theory in the empirical social sciences means very different things in different contexts. In this book, we will refer to a theory is an explanation of a phenomeon: a theory provides an account of how or under what conditions a set of causal relationships operate. Moreover, we can express both a theory and the claims being theorized as causal models. A theory, then, is a model that explains and implies another modelpossibly with the help of some data. We discuss toward the end of the chapter how this definition of theory relates to common understandings of theory in the social sciences. First, however, we focus on unpacking our working definition. In embedding theorization within the world of causal models, we ultimately have an empirical objective in mind. Theorizing a causal relationship of interest, in our framework, means elaborating our causal beliefs about the world in greater detail. As we show in later chapters, theorizing in the form of a causal model allows us to generate research designs: to identify sources of inferential leverage and to explicitly and systematically link observations of components of a causal system to the causal questions we seek to answer. 3.1 Theory as a lower-level model Let us say that a causal model, \\(M^\\prime\\), is a theory of \\(M\\) if \\(M\\) is implied by \\(M^\\prime\\). Theory is, thus, all relative. \\(M^\\prime\\) might itself sit atop a theory, \\(M^{\\prime\\prime}\\), that implies \\(M^\\prime\\). To help fix the idea of theory as supporting or underlying the model(s) it theorizes, we refer to the theory, \\(M^\\prime\\), as a lower-level model relative to \\(M\\) and refer to \\(M\\) as a higher-level model relative to its theorization, \\(M^\\prime\\).1 We illustrate showing two models, \\(M^\\prime\\), \\(M^{\\prime\\prime}\\) that each imply a model \\(M\\). In each case the lower level models contain additional nodes in a way that allows for a kind of disaggregation of exogenous nodes. Figure 3.1: Here we represent the simple claim that one variable causes another, and two theories  lower-level models  that could explain this claim. Both model (b) and model (c) involve theorization via disaggregation of nodes. We start with the higher-level model, \\(M\\), represented in Figure 3.1(a). We can then offer the model, \\(M^\\prime\\) in panel (b) as a theory, a lower-level model, of \\(M\\). We have added a node, \\(K\\), in the causal chain between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), a familiar mode of theorization. In doing do we have in fact split the error \\(\\theta^Y\\) into two parts: \\(\\theta^{Y_\\text{lower}}\\) and \\(\\theta^K\\). Intuitively, in the higher-level model, (a), \\(Y\\) is a function of \\(X\\) and a disturbance \\(\\theta^Y\\), the latter representing all things other than \\(X\\) than can affect \\(Y\\). In our four-type setup, \\(\\theta^Y\\) represents all of the (unspecified) sources of variation in \\(X\\)s effect on \\(Y\\). When we add \\(K\\), \\(X\\) now does not directly affect \\(Y\\) but only does so via \\(K\\). Further, we model \\(X\\) as acting on \\(K\\) with error, with \\(\\theta^K\\) representing all of the (unspecified) factors determining \\(X\\)s effect on \\(K\\). The key thing to notice here is that \\(\\theta^K\\) now represents a portion of the variance that \\(\\theta^Y\\) represented in the higher-level graph: some of the variation in \\(X\\)s effect on \\(Y\\) now arises from \\(X\\)s effect on \\(K\\), which is captured by \\(\\theta^K\\). So, for instance, \\(X\\) might have no effect on \\(Y\\) because \\(\\theta^K\\) takes on a value such that \\(X\\) has no effect on \\(K\\). Likewise, any effect of \\(X\\) on \\(Y\\) must arise from an effect of \\(X\\) on \\(K\\), captured in \\(\\theta^K\\)s value.2 What \\(\\theta^K\\) represents, then, is that part of the original \\(\\theta^Y\\) that arose from some force other than \\(X\\) operating at the first step of the causal chain from \\(X\\) to \\(Y\\). So now, \\(\\theta^Y\\) is not quite the same entity in the lower-level graph that it was in the higher-level graph. In the original graph, \\(\\theta^Y\\) represented all sources of variation in \\(X\\)s effect on \\(Y\\). In the lower-level model, with \\(K\\) as mediator, \\(\\theta^Y\\) represents only random variation in \\(K\\)s effect on \\(Y\\). \\(\\theta^Y\\) has been expunged of any factors shaping the first stage of the causal process, which now reside in \\(\\theta^K\\). Reflecting a convention that we use throughout the book, we highlight this change in \\(\\theta^Y\\)s meaning by referring in the second model to \\(\\theta^{Y_\\text{lower}}\\). Theorization here thus starts with the proliferation of substantive variablesadding beliefs about intervening steps in a causal process. But, critically, it also involves an accompanying disaggregation of unexplained variation. Addition and splitting thus go hand-in-hand: the insertion of a mediator between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) also involves the splitting of \\(Y\\)s unspecified parent (\\(\\theta_Y\\)). Consider next model \\(M&#39;&#39;\\) panel (c) in Figure 3.1, which also supports (implies) the higher-level theory in panel \\((a)\\). The logical relationship between models \\((a)\\) and \\((c)\\), however, is somewhat different. Here the lower-level model specifies one of the conditions that comprised \\(\\theta^Y\\) in the higher-level model. In specifying a moderator, \\(C\\), we have extracted \\(C\\) from \\(\\theta^Y\\), leaving \\(\\theta^{Y_\\text{lower}}\\) to represent all factors other than \\(C\\) that condition \\(X\\)s effect on \\(Y\\). (Again, the relabeling as \\(\\theta^{Y_\\text{lower}}\\) reflects this change in the terms meaning.) While we might add a \\(\\theta^C\\) term pointing into \\(C\\), this is not necessary. Whereas in Model (b) we have extracted \\(\\theta^K\\) from \\(\\theta^Y\\), in Model (c), it is \\(C\\) itself that we have extracted from \\(\\theta^Y\\), substantively specifying what had been just a random disturbance. Critically, notice that since lower level models imply higher level models we think of theories as implying the models they are theorizing. If you believe Model \\(M&#39;\\), then you also must believe Model \\(M\\). If it is possible that \\(X\\) can affect \\(K\\) and possible that \\(K\\) can affect \\(Y\\) then it is possible that \\(X\\) can affect \\(Y\\). The converse is not true, however. It is not possible to still believe that \\(X\\) can effect \\(Y\\) if you do not think that \\(X\\) can affect \\(K\\). Similarly, if you believe Model (c), then you must also believe Model (a): if it is true that \\(X\\) can affect \\(Y\\), possibly in ways that are moderated by \\(C\\), then it is trivially true, more simply, that \\(X\\) can affect \\(Y\\). 3.2 Illustration of unpacking causal types We now show more specifically how causal types in lower level models map into causal types in higher level models. For concreteness, let us return to our democratization example and consider first the very basic claim that inequality can have an affect on democratization. We represent this simple claim in Figure 3.2, Panel (a). In this simple model, \\(I\\) may sometimes have an effect of \\(D\\), and sometimes not; and that effect may be positive or negative. All of this will depend on the cases causal type. Figure 3.2: DAG representations of three theories. DAGs only capture claims that one variable causes another, conditional on other variables. Theories (b) and (c) each imply theory (a). In addition the figure shows two models that each explain Model (a), though in different ways. Model (b) answers the explanatory question, How does inequality affect democratization? Model (c) answers the explanatory question, Why does inequalitys effect on democratization vary? Both theories provide richer, more interpretable accounts of the phenomenon of interest than the simpler model that they are theorizing. These lower level models imply a set of causal types that are richer than that implied by (a). Recall that in Chapter 2, we considered the idea that at any node, a causal type may be conceptualized as a case specific disturbance, that governs the mapping from input variables to outcome variables. In particular if we deploy our four-causal-type function from Chapter 2 we have: \\(a\\): \\(\\theta^D=\\theta^D_{10}\\), then \\(D=1-I\\) (\\(I\\) has a negative effect on \\(D\\)) \\(b\\): \\(\\theta^D=\\theta^D_{01}\\), then \\(D=I\\) (\\(I\\) has a positive effect on \\(D\\)) \\(c\\): \\(\\theta^D=\\theta^D_{00}\\), then \\(D=0\\) (\\(I\\) has no causal effect) \\(d\\): \\(\\theta^D=\\theta^D_{11}\\), then \\(D=1\\) (\\(I\\) has no causal effect) Knowing \\(\\theta\\) tells us how \\(D\\) responds to \\(I\\) and it ignores any heterogeneity between units as long they respond in the same way. For any causal type the model is consistent with \\(I\\)s causal effect operating for different reasons for different units, but these differences are left entirely unaccounted for. 3.2.1 Type disaggregation in a mediation model Model (b) has causal types defined for nodes \\(M\\) and for \\(D\\). As with the overall \\(I,D\\) relationship. We thus allow \\(I\\) to have a positive, negative, or no effect on \\(M\\), with \\(\\theta^M\\) taking on four possible values, again corresponding to \\(a,b,c,d\\) nodal types (now: a: \\(\\theta_{10}^M\\), b: \\(\\theta_{01}^M\\), c: \\(\\theta_{00}^M\\), d: \\(\\theta_{11}^M\\)). And we allow for \\(M\\) to have a positive, negative, or no effect on \\(D\\), with \\(\\theta^D_{\\text{lower}}\\) possible values again being one of four nodal types (\\(\\theta_{10}^D\\), \\(\\theta_{01}^D\\), \\(\\theta_{00}^D\\), \\(\\theta_{11}^D\\)). We can now think about combinations of types in the lower-level model as mapping onto types in the higher-level model. Table 3.1 illustrates. Table 3.1: Mapping from lower level nodal types on \\(M\\) and \\(D\\) to higher level causal types on \\(D\\). \\(\\theta_{10}^{D_{lower}}\\) \\(\\theta_{01}^{D_{lower}}\\) \\(\\theta_{00}^{D_{lower}}\\) \\(\\theta_{11}^{D_{lower}}\\) \\(\\theta_{10}^{M}\\) \\(\\theta_{01}^{D_{higher}}\\) \\(\\theta_{10}^{D_{higher}}\\) \\(\\theta_{00}^{D_{higher}}\\) \\(\\theta_{11}^{D_{higher}}\\) \\(\\theta_{01}^{M}\\) \\(\\theta_{10}^{D_{higher}}\\) \\(\\theta_{01}^{D_{higher}}\\) \\(\\theta_{00}^{D_{higher}}\\) \\(\\theta_{11}^{D_{higher}}\\) \\(\\theta_{00}^{M}\\) \\(\\theta_{11}^{D_{higher}}\\) \\(\\theta_{00}^{D_{higher}}\\) \\(\\theta_{00}^{D_{higher}}\\) \\(\\theta_{11}^{D_{higher}}\\) \\(\\theta_{11}^{M}\\) \\(\\theta_{00}^{D_{higher}}\\) \\(\\theta_{11}^{D_{higher}}\\) \\(\\theta_{00}^{D_{higher}}\\) \\(\\theta_{11}^{D_{higher}}\\) For instance, in a case in which both \\(\\theta^M=\\theta^M_{01}\\) (a positive effect of \\(I\\) on \\(M\\)) and \\(\\theta^{D_{\\text{lower}}}=\\theta_{01}^{D_{lower}}\\) (a positive effect of \\(M\\) on \\(D\\)), we have a positive effect of \\(I\\) on \\(D\\)meaning that, in the higher-level model, \\(\\theta^{D_{higher}}=\\theta^{D_{higher}}_{01}\\). Two linked negative effects also generate a positive effect of \\(I\\) on \\(D\\) and so map onto the same higher-level type. Further, it is easy to see that if there is no causal effect at either the \\(I \\rightarrow M\\) step or the \\(M \\rightarrow D\\) step, we will have one of the null effect types at the higher level since, in this model, \\(I\\) cannot affect \\(D\\) unless there are causal effects at both constituent steps.3 To foreshadow the discussion in later chapters, these mappings are critical: they allow us to use inferences drawn at a lower level to answer questions posed at a higher level. 3.2.2 Type disaggregation in a moderation model Alternatively, we might wonder why inequality causes democratization. Our simple claim, in panel (a), allows that \\(I\\) can cause \\(D\\), but provides no information about the conditions under which it does so. Those conditions are implicitly embedded within \\(\\theta^D\\), where they are left unspecified. We could, however, theorize some of what is left unsaid in in panel (a). We do this in panel (c), where we posit ethnic homogeneity (\\(E\\)) as a moderator of inequalitys effect on democratization. Panel (c) represents a theory of panel (a) in that it can help account for variation in causal effects that is unaccounted for by the model in (a). Model (c) has thus given substantive meaning to an aspect of the phenomenon that was merely residual variation in Model (a). Model (a) provides no account of why inequality has the effects it does, relying fully on \\(\\theta^D\\) as a placeholder for this uncertainty. In Model (c), \\(\\theta^D\\) plays a more modest role, with ethnic homogeneity doing a good deal of the work of determining inequalitys possible effects. In this graph, we again have a \\(\\theta_D^{\\text{lower}}\\) term, but it is a different object from \\(\\theta_D^{\\text{lower}}\\) in the mediation graph. In this moderation model, \\(\\theta_D^{\\text{lower}}\\) is more complex as it determines the mapping from two binary variables into \\(D\\). A causal type in this setup now represents how a case will respond to four different possible combinations of \\(I\\) and \\(E\\) values. Rather than four causal types, we now have 16, as there are 16 possible ways in which a case might respond to two binary variables (see Table ?? in Chapter 2). In Table 3.2 we give a mapping from a subset of these lower level types to the upper level types corresponding to the model in (a). Table 3.2: Values for \\(D\\) given \\(E\\) and \\(I\\). With two binary causal variables, there are 16 nodal types: 16 ways in which \\(Y\\) depends on \\(I\\) and \\(E\\). These lower level types map into higher level types for a model in which \\(Y\\) depends on \\(I\\) only, as shown in the final column. Low Type \\(I=0,E=0\\) \\(I=0,E=1\\) \\(I=1,E=0\\) \\(I=1, E=1\\) High Type \\(\\theta^{D}_{0000}\\) 0 0 0 0 \\(\\theta^{D}_{00}\\) \\(\\theta^{D}_{0001}\\) \\(\\theta^{D}_{0010}\\) 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 \\(\\theta^{D}_{01}\\) if \\(E=1\\), else \\(\\theta^D_{00}\\) \\(\\theta^D_{00}\\) if \\(E=1\\), else \\(\\theta^D_{01}\\) \\(\\theta^{D}_{0011}\\) 0 0 1 1 \\(\\theta^{D}_{01}\\) \\(\\vdots\\) \\(\\vdots\\) \\(\\vdots\\) \\(\\vdots\\) \\(\\vdots\\) \\(\\vdots\\) \\(\\theta^{D}_{1110}\\) 1 1 1 0 \\(\\theta^D_{11}\\) if \\(E=0\\), else \\(\\theta^D_{10}\\) \\(\\theta^{D}_{1111}\\) 1 1 1 1 \\(\\theta^D_{11}\\) Importantly we see that the mapping between lower- and higher-level types can depend on the value of the moderator. More generally, since we can think of the value of exogeneous nodes, \\(E\\) and \\(I\\), as being nodal types for those nodes, we can think of the lower level nodal type as a concatenation of the upper level nodal types for \\(E\\) and \\(D\\). Thus we can think of the the higher level type as depending uniquely on the fully specified lower level type. For instance, a case that has type \\(\\theta_{01}\\) in the higher-level model if it has type \\(\\theta_{0010}\\) in the lower-level model and \\(E=0\\). This is a case for which \\(I\\) has a positive effect on \\(D\\) when \\(E=0\\) and in which \\(E\\) is in fact 0. On the other hand, the same lower level type, in combination with \\(E=1\\) maps onto the type \\(\\theta_{10}\\) in the higher-level modela type in which \\(D\\) responds negatively to \\(I\\). In later chapters, we represent all lower- to higher-level mappings relevant to a question of interest with the use of type-reduction tables that allow one to readily see how inferences drawn at one level inform causal questions posed at another level. 3.3 Rules for moving between higher- and lower-level models Thinking about models as conditionally nested within one another can be empirically useful. It provides a way of generating empirical leverage on a causal question by plumbing more deeply our background knowledge about a domain of interest. When we more fully specify higher-level claims via a more elaborate, lower-level model, we are a making explicit unspecified conditions on which the higher-level relationships depend. In doing this, we are identifying potentially observable nodes that might be informative about our research question. As we develop lower-level models to support our claims, or determine which claims are supported by our theories, what kinds of moves are we permitted to make? One important thing to note is that the mappings between higher-level claims and theories may not be one-to-one. A single theory can support multiple higher-level theories. Moreover, a single higher-level relation can be supported by multiple, possibly incompatible lower-level theories. To illustrate, consider two lower level theories of democratization: (\\(L_1\\)): Inequality \\(\\rightarrow\\) Democratization \\(\\leftarrow\\) Mobilization (\\(L_2\\)): Inequality \\(\\rightarrow\\) Mobilization \\(\\rightarrow\\) Democratization Note how these theories are incompatible with one another. While Inequality and Democratization are independent in \\(L_1\\), they are causally related in \\(L_2\\). Moreover, in \\(L_2\\), Inequality and Democratization are related only through Mobilization, while in \\(L_1\\), Democratization is directly affected by Inequality.4 Now, consider the following three higher-level claims: (\\(H_1\\)): Inequality \\(\\rightarrow\\) Democratization (\\(H_2\\)): Mobilization \\(\\rightarrow\\) Democratization (\\(H_3\\)): Inequality \\(\\rightarrow\\) Mobilization \\(H_1\\) could be derived from (explained by) either theory, \\(L_1\\) or \\(L_2\\). Although the two theories are incompatible with one another, in both theories \\(Inequality\\) affects Democratization. Both theories likewise imply \\(H_2\\), in which Mobilization affects Democratization. \\(H_3\\), however, can be supported only by one of these theories: only in \\(L_2\\), and not in \\(L_1\\), does \\(Inequality\\) cause Mobilization.5 Thus multiple (possibly incompatible) theories can usually be proposed to explain any given causal effect. When seeking an explanation for, say, \\(H_1\\), the choice between \\(L_1\\) and \\(L_2\\) is not dictated by logic; it must be drawn from a substantive belief about which set of causal dependencies operates in the world. On the other hand, \\(L_2\\) is logically ruled out as an explanation of \\(H_3\\). Further, any given theory logically implies multiple (necessarily compatible) higher-level claims about causal relations. What, more generally, are the permissible moves across levels? 3.3.1 Moving down levels We have already discussed two possible forms of theorization  moves down a level: (i) disaggregating existing nodes, i.e., by introducing beliefs about mediation or moderation, or (ii) adding nodes representing variation in a feature of context that is implicitly held constant in the higher-level model. There are other possible ways of elaborating a model. For instance, we can add antecedent conditions: causes of nodes that were exogenous in the higher-level model. Likewise, we can add downstream effects: outcomes of nodes that were terminal in the higher-level model. Figure 3.3: A higher-level model and a lower-level model that is impermissible. The central principle governing allowable elaborations is that a lower-level model must not introduce dependencies between variables that were omitted in the higher-level model. We provide an example of a violation of this principle in Figure 3.3. We start with a higher-level model, in panel (a), in which inequality affects democratization through mobilization. We then elaborate the model in panel (b) by adding ethnic homogeneity as a moderator of mobilizations effect. However, because ethnic homogeneity is also modeled here as affecting inequality, we have now introduced a source of dependence between inequality and democratization that was omitted from the higher-level model. In panel (a), democratization and inequality were dependent only via mobilization; and so they are conditionally independent given mobilization. In panel (b), democratization and mobilization are additionally dependent via their common cause, ethnic homogeneity. By the rules governing causal graphs (see Chapter ), the higher-level specifically prohibited this second source of dependencysince all dependencies between variables must be represented. Put differently, if two variables are independent or conditionally independent given a third variablein one model, then this same relation of independence (or conditional independence) must be captured in any theory of that model. A theory can add conditional independencies not present in the higher-level model. For instance, a mediation theory, \\(X \\rightarrow M \\rightarrow Y\\), implies a conditional independence that is not present in the higher-level model that it supports, \\(X \\rightarrow Y\\): in the lower-level model only, \\(X\\) is conditionally independent of \\(Y\\) given \\(M\\). But we may not theorize away (conditional) independencies insisted on by our higher-level claim. 3.3.2 Moving up levels Moving in the other direction, what, in general, are the permissible simplifications of lower-level models? In other words, given a theory, what are the higher-level claims that it can support? When we move up a level  i.e., eliminate one or more nodes  the key rule is that the higher-level graph must take into account: all dependencies among remaining nodes and all variation generated by the eliminated node. We can work out what this means, separately, for eliminating endogenous nodes and for eliminating exogenous nodes. Eliminating endogenous nodes Eliminating an endogenous node means removing a node with parents (direct causes) represented on the graph. If the node also has one or more children, then the node captures a dependency: it links its parents to its children. When we eliminate this node, preserving these dependencies requires that all of the eliminated nodes parents adoptbecome parents ofall of the eliminated nodes children. Thus, for instance in panel (b) of Figure 3.1, if we were to eliminate \\(M\\), \\(M\\)s parents (\\(X\\) and \\(\\theta^M\\)) need to adopt \\(M\\)s child, \\(Y\\). We see in panel (a) of the figure, the higher-level model, that \\(X\\) is now pointing directly into \\(Y\\). As for \\(\\theta^M\\), it too must now point directly into \\(Y\\)though we can use a bit of shorthand to make this happen. Recall that \\(\\theta^M\\) represents the part of \\(M\\) that is randomly determined. Rather than drawing two separate disturbance (\\(\\theta\\)) terms pointing into \\(Y\\), however, we more simply represent the combined disturbance term as \\(\\theta^Y_{\\text{higher}}\\), with the higher signaling the aggregation of roots. (This is, of course, simply reversing the disaggregation that we undertook earlier to move from the higher- to the lower-level model.) More intuitively, when we simplify away a mediator, we need to make sure that we preserve the causal relationships being mediatedboth those among substantive variables and any random shocks at the mediating causal steps.6 Eliminating exogenous nodes What about eliminating exogenous nodesnodes with no parents? For the most part, exogenous nodes cannot be eliminated, but must either be replaced by or incorporated into \\(U\\) (or \\(\\theta\\)) terms. The reason is that we need preserve any dependencies or variation generated by the exogenous node. Figure 3.4 walks through four different situations in which we might want to simplify away the exogenous node, \\(X\\). (Here we use the more generic \\(U\\) notation, though the same principles apply if these are type-receptacles(\\(\\theta\\).) Figure 3.4: Here we represent the basic principles for eliminating exogenous nodes. Multiple children. In (a1), we start with a lower-level model in which \\(X\\) has two children, thus generating a dependency between \\(W\\) and \\(Y\\). If we eliminate \\(X\\), we must preserve this dependency. We can do so, as pictured in (a2), by replacing \\(X\\) with a \\(U\\) term that also points into \\(W\\) and \\(Y\\).7 Though we are no longer specifying what it is that connects \\(W\\) and \\(Y\\), the correlation itself is retained. Substantive spouse. In (b1), \\(X\\) has a spouse that is substantively specified, \\(W\\). If we eliminate \\(X\\), we have to preserve the fact that \\(Y\\) is not fully determined by \\(W\\); something else also generates variation in \\(Y\\). We thus need to replace \\(X\\) with a \\(U\\) term, \\(U_Y\\), to capture the variation in \\(Y\\) that is not accounted for by \\(W\\). \\(U\\)-term spouse. In (c1), \\(X\\) has a spouse that is not substantively specified, \\(U^{Y_\\text{lower}}\\). Eliminating \\(X\\) requires, again, capturing the variance that it generates as a random input. As we already have a \\(U\\) term pointing only into \\(Y\\), we can substitute in \\(U^{Y_\\text{higher}}\\), which represents both \\(U^{Y_\\text{lower}}\\) and the variance generated by \\(X\\).8 One child, no spouse. In (d1), \\(X\\) has only one child and no spouse. Here we can safely eliminate \\(X\\) with no loss of information. It is always understood that every exogenous node has some cause, and there is no loss of information in simply eliminating a nodes causes if those causes are exogenous and do not affect other endogenous nodes in the model. In (d2) we are simply not specifying \\(Y\\)s cause, but we have not lost any dependencies or sources of variance that had been expressed in (d1). One interesting effect of eliminating a substantive exogenous node can be to render seemingly deterministic relations effectively probabilistic. In moving from (b1) to (b2), we have taken a component of \\(Y\\) that was determined by \\(X\\) and converting it into a random disturbance. Just as we can explain a more probabilistic claim with a less probabilistic theory, we can derive higher-level claims with greater probabilism from theories with greater determinism. Figure 3.5: A lower-level model from which multiple higher level models can be derived. Figure 3.6: Higher level models derived from the lower level model of Figure X. Nodes that are eliminated are marked in grey; circles denote exogenous nodes that are replaced in subgraphs by unidentified variables. (A circled node pointing into two other nodes could equivalently be indicated as an undirected edge connecting the two.) Note that \\(M\\), \\(R\\), and \\(D\\) are deterministic functions of \\(I\\) and \\(E\\) in this example. We can apply these principles to a model of any complexity. We illustrate a wider range of simplifications by starting with Figure 3.5, which represents a somewhat amended version of our inequality and democratization model from Chapter 2, with more complex causal relations. Then, in Figure 3.6, we show all permissible reductions of the more elaborate model. We can think of these reductions as the full set of simpler claims (involving at least two nodes) that can be derived from the lower-level theory. In each subgraph, we mark eliminated nodes in grey; those nodes that are circled must be replaced with \\(U\\) terms; and arrows represent the causal dependencies that must be preserved. Note, for instance, that neither \\(E\\) (because it has a spouse) nor \\(I\\) (because it has multiple children) can be simply eliminated; each must be replaced with a \\(U\\) term. Also, the higher-level graph with nodes missing can contain arrows that do not appear at all in the lower-level graph: eliminating \\(M\\), for instance, forces an arrow running from \\(X\\) to \\(R\\) and another running from \\(X\\) to \\(Y\\), as \\(X\\) must adopt \\(M\\)s children. The simplest elimination is of \\(D\\) itself since it does not encode any dependencies between other variables. We can also read Figure 3.6 as telling us the set of claims for which the lower-level graph in Figure can serve as a theory. As we can see, the range of claims that a moderately complex model can theorize is vast. For each simpler claim, moreover, there may be other possible lower-level graphstheories besides consistent with it. 3.3.2.1 Conditioning on nodes A further permissible upward move is conditioning on a node. When we condition on a node, we are restricting the higher-level model in scope to situations in which that nodes value is held constant. Doing so allows us to eliminate the node as well as all arrows pointing into it or out of it. Consider three different situations in which we might condition on a node: Exogenous, with multiple children. In simplifying (a1) in Figure 3.4, we need to be sure we retain any dependence that \\(X\\) generates between \\(W\\) and \\(Y\\). However, recalling the rules of conditional independence on a graph (see Chapter ), we know that \\(W\\) and \\(Y\\) are independent conditional on \\(X\\). Put differently, if we restrict the analysis to contexts in which \\(X\\) takes on a constant value, the lower-level model implies that \\(Y\\) and \\(W\\) will be uncorrelated across cases. As fixing \\(X\\)s value breaks the dependence between \\(Y\\) and \\(W\\), we can drop \\(X\\) (and the arrows pointing out of it) without having to represent that dependence. Exogenous, with spouse. In simplifying (b1) or (c1) in Figure 3.4, we need to account for the variation generated by \\(X\\). If we fix \\(X\\)s value, however, then we eliminate this variation by assumption and do not need to continue to represent it (or the arrow pointing out of it) on the graph. Endogenous. When we condition on an endogenous node, we can eliminate the node as well the arrows pointing into and out of it. We, again, leverage relations of conditional independence here. If we start with graph (b) in Figure 3.1, and we condition on the mediator, \\(M\\), we sever the link between \\(Y\\) on \\(X\\), rendering them conditionally independent of one another. We can thus remove \\(M\\), the arrow from \\(X\\) to \\(M\\), and the arrow from \\(M\\) to \\(Y\\). In the new model, with \\(M\\) fixed, \\(Y\\) will be entirely determined by the random disturbance \\(\\theta^{Y_\\text{lower}}\\).9 In sum, we can work with models that are simpler than our causal beliefs: we may believe a complex lower-level model to be true, but we can derive from it a sparer set of claims. There may be intervening causal steps or features of context that we believe matter, but that are not of interest for a particular line of inquiry. While these can be removed, we nonetheless have to make sure that their implications for the relations remaining in the model are not lost. Understanding the rules of reduction allow us to undertake an important task: checking which simpler claims are and are not consistent with our full belief set. 3.3.2.2 Relation to technical literature Formally moving from lower level DAG to a higher level DAG requires marginalization: assessing the joint marginal distribution of observed nodes in the higher level graph over the distribution of unobserved nodes in the lower level graph. Unfortunately there is no guarantee that the margin of a distribution that is consistent with a lower level DAG will be consistent with any higher level DAG (techically, DAGS are not closed under marginalization). In response, various types of richer graphs have been developed, such as acyclic directed mixed graphs (ADMGs) Maximal Ancestral Graphs (Spirtes and Richardson, Ancestral graph Markov models, 2002), or mDAGs (Evans 2015 (Graphs for Margins)). See also (Wermuth 2011) ADMGs for example have directed and bidirected edges but no directed cycles and are closed under marginalization. We use two approaches in our applications to engage with this problem. First we generally allow for unobserved confounding in models. Second we will allow for the estimation of lower level models with unobserved nodes. 3.4 Conclusion We close this chapter by considering how the understanding of theory that we work with in this book compares to other prominent understandings of theory. Theory as tautology. The claim that the number of Nash equilibria is generically odd in finite games is often understood to be a theoretical claim. Unless there are errors in the derivation of the result, the claim is true in the sense that the conclusions follow from the assumptions. There is no evidence that we could go looking for in the world to assess the claim. The same can be said of the theoretical claims of many formal models in social sciences; they are theoretical deductions of the if-then variety (Clarke and Primo 2012). Theory in this sense is true by tautology. By contrast, theory as we define it in this book refers to claims with empirical content: a theory refers to causal relations in the world that might or might not hold, and is susceptible to empirical testing. The deductive logical relations that hold in a causal model are those of conditional independence, as discussed in Chapter 2: for instance, if \\(X\\) causes \\(Y\\) only through \\(M\\) in a theory, then \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are conditionally independent given some value of \\(M\\). Theory as a collection of maps. According to Clarke and Primo (2012), building on a semantic view of theory (Giere (2010)), a theory is a collection of models, together with a set of hypotheses linking them to the real world. As in our usage, Clarke and Primo see theories and models as very similar objects: for them, a theory is a system of models; for us, a theory is a supporting model. In both frameworks, there is no real difference in kind between models and theories. Our approach also shares with Clarke and Primo the idea that models are not full and faithful reflections of reality; they are maps designed for a particular purpose. In the case of causal models, the purpose is to capture relationships of independence and possible causal dependence. As we have shown, that is a purpose that allows for the stripping away of detailthough it also forbids certain simplifications (such as any simplification that removes a dependency between variables). Clarke and Primo see models as useful to the extent that they are similar to features of the real world in ways related to the models purpose. Along these lines, a causal model will be useful to the extent that it posits relations of independence that are similar to those prevailing in the domain under investigation. Theory as a testable claim In the hypothetico-deductive framework, often traced back to Popper (2002) and highly influential in empirical political science, empirical social science is an activity of theory-testing. Having developed a theory, we then derive from it a set of empirical predictions and then test those predictions against evidence. In Clarke and Primo (2012), we also seek to confirm theories by developing and testing hypotheses about the similarity of a model or theory to particular features of the world. In both cases, a theory is positedpossibly on the basis of logic or background knowledgeand then assessed. The value (truth or usefulness) of the model itself is the object of inquiry. In a causal-model framework, theories are always tentative, and we can subject any model or theory to empirical evaluation, a task to which we turn in Chapter 16. However, in the books setup, theories are first and foremost expressions of what we already know and dont know about a given causal domain when inquiry begins. We encode this background knowledge in order to inform research-design choices and draw inferences from the data. Models and theories are thus, in this sense, the world within which inquiry unfolds. Indeed, as we explore in Chapter 4, the very questions we ask live withincan be represented as parts ofour theories. Theory as generalization In another of the many uses of theory, political scientists often think of theorization as generalization. For Van Evera (1997) and Przeworski and Teune (1970), for instance, theories are by their nature general statements that we can use to explain specific events. In this view, Diamond resources caused Sierra Leones civil war is a case-specific explanation; Natural resource endowments cause civil war is a theoretical formulation. In our treatment of theory as a lower-level causal model, however, there is no generic sense in which a theory is more or less general than the higher-level claim that it explains. In this books framework, we can theorize by generalizing: when we elaborate a model by building in variation in a factor that was held constant in the higher-level claim, we are making the model more general in scope. If our natural resources claim implicitly applies only to weak states, we can theorize this claim by allowing state strength to vary and articulating how the natural-resource effect hinges on that claim. However, when we theorize by disaggregating nodessay, by adding intervening causal stepswe have in fact made a more specific claim. Natural resources may cause civil war under a broad set of circumstances. Natural resources will cause civil war through looting by rebel groups under an almost certainly narrower set of circumstances. Here, the more elaborate argumentthe theorization of why \\(X\\) causes \\(Y\\)is actually a stronger claim, with narrower scope, than the simpler one that it supports. The value of parsimony Van Evera (1997) and Przeworski and Teune (1970) also express a common view in characterizing parsimony as a quality of good theory. While they recognize that parsimony must often be traded off against other goods, such as accuracy and generality, ceteris paribus a more parsimonious theoryone that uses fewer causal variables to explain variation in a given outcomeis commonly understood to be a better theory. We do not take issue with the idea that simpler models and explanations are, all else equal, better. But the succeeding chapters also demonstrate a distinctive and important way in which all else will often not be equal when we seek to use theory to guide research design and support causal inference. To foreshadow the argument to come, the elaboration of more detailed, lower-level models can direct us to new opportunities for learning. As we unpack a higher-level claim, we will often be identifying additional features of a phenomenon the observation of which can shed light on causal questions of interest. Moreover, our background beliefsthe prior knowledge on which causal inference must usually restare often more informative at lower levels than at higher levels: it will, for instance, often be easier for us express beliefs about causal effects for smaller steps along a causal chain than about an overarching \\(X \\rightarrow Y\\) effect. Making things more complicated, of course, still makes things more complicated. And we should avoid doing so when the payoff is small, as it will sometimes be. But in the pages to come, we will also see a distinct set of benefits that arise from drilling more deeply into our basis of prior knowledge when formulating inferential strategies. 3.4.1 Quantifying the gains of a theory What are the gains of a thoery that introduces a node \\(K\\) relative to one that does not include \\(K\\). What is the value added of the more elaborate theory? One approach to assessing the contribution of a theory is to calculate the mean reduction in Bayes risk: \\[\\text{Gains from theory} = 1- \\frac{E_{K|W}(Var(Q|K,W))}{Var(Q|W)}\\] This is a kind of \\(R^2\\) measure (see also Gelman and Pardoe (2006)). Another approach is to ask: how much better are my guesses now compared to what I would have guessed before, given what I know now. Expected wisdom. \\[Wisdom = \\int(q_0 - q)^2 - (q_k - q)^2 p(q | k)dq\\] This captures how much better off we are with the guess we have made given current data (\\(q_k\\)) compared to the guess we woudl have made without it (\\(q_0\\)), knowing what we know now (\\(p(q|k)\\). An advantage of this conceptualization is that you can record gains in learning even if posterior variance is larger than prior variance. Even still the implications for strategy are the same since wisdom is maximized by a strategy that reduces expected squared error. Other possible measures of gains from theory might include the simple correlation between \\(K\\) and \\(Q\\), or entropy-based measures (see Zhang and Srihari (2003) for many more possibilities). For this problem the correlation is given by (see appendix): \\[\\rho_{KQ} = \\frac{(\\phi_b+\\phi_d)(1-2p)(p(1-p))^{.5}}{ (p\\phi_b+(1-p)\\phi_d)(1-(p\\phi_b+(1-p)\\phi_d)))^{.5}}\\] One might also use a measure of mutual information from information theory: \\[I(Q,K) = \\sum_q \\sum_k P(q,k)\\log\\left(\\frac{P(q,k)}{P(q)P(k)}\\right)\\] To express this mutual information as a share of variation explained, we could divide \\(I(Q,K)\\) by the entropy of \\(Q\\), \\(H(Q)\\) where \\(H(Q) = -\\sum_qP(q)\\log(P(q))\\). The resulting ratio can be interpreted as 1 minus the ratio of the entropy of \\(Q\\) conditional (on \\(K\\)) to the unconditional entropy of \\(Q\\). For this example, Figure shows gains as a function of \\(\\phi_b\\) given a fixed value of \\(\\phi_d\\). The figure also shows other possible measures of probative value, with, in this case, the reduction in entropy tracking the reduced posterior variance closely. Figure 3.7: The solid line shows gains in precision (reduced posterior variance) for different values of \\(\\phi_b\\) given \\(\\phi_d=0.25\\) and \\(p=.5\\) for the example given in the text. Additional measures of probative value are also provided including \\(|\\phi_b - \\phi_d|\\), the correlation of \\(K\\) and \\(Q\\), and the reduction in entropy in \\(Q\\) due to mutual information in \\(Q\\) and \\(K\\). 3.5 Chapter Appendices 3.5.1 Summary Boxes BOX 1 Two kinds of theories. Theories are lower-level causal models that explain or provide an account of a higher-level, simpler model. There are two forms of theorization: The disaggregation of nodes. A single node in a higher-level model can be split into multiple nodes. For instance, for a higher-level model in which \\(X \\rightarrow Y \\leftarrow \\theta^Y\\): Mediation: A mediator, \\(M\\), can be introduced between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), thus splitting \\(\\theta^Y\\) into \\(\\theta^M\\) and \\(\\theta^{Y_\\text{lower}}\\). The mediation theory thus explains the \\(X \\rightarrow Y\\) relationship. Moderation: A component of \\(\\theta^Y\\) can be extracted and specified as a substantive variable. This variable is now a substantively conceptualized moderator of the \\(X \\rightarrow Y\\) relationship. The moderation theory thus provides a fuller explanation of why \\(X\\) has different effects on \\(Y\\) in different contexts. Generalization. A feature of context omitted and implicitly held constant in a higher-level model can be explicitly included in the model. The higher-level model is now explained as a special case of a more general set of causal relations. BOX 2 Rules for moving between levels Moving down levels: All (conditional) independencies represented in a higher-level model must be preserved in the lower-level model. When we disaggregate or add nodes to a model, new conditional independencies can be generated. But any variables that are independent or conditionally independent (given a third variable) in the higher-level model must also be independent or conditionally independent in the lower-level model. Moving up levels: We can move up levels by eliminating an exogenous node, eliminating an endogenous node, or conditioning on a node. When we eliminate a node from a model, we must preserve any variation and dependencies that it generates: When eliminating an endogenous node, that nodes parents adopt (become direct causes of) that nodes children. When eliminating an exogenous node, we must usually replace it with a \\(U\\) term. If the node has more than one child, it must be replaced with a \\(U\\) term pointing into both children (or an undirected edge connecting them) to preserve the dependency between its children. If the node has a spouse, the eliminated nodes variation must also be preserved using a \\(U\\) term. Where the spouse is (already) a \\(U\\) term with no other children, \\(U\\) terms can be combined. Since conditioning on a node blocks the path through which it connects its children, we can simply eliminate the node and the arrows between it and its children. An exogenous node with no spouse and only one child can be simply eliminated. 3.5.2 Illustration of a Mapping from a Game to a DAG Our running example supports a set of higher level models, but it can also be implied by a lower level models. Here we illustrate with an example in which the lower level model is a game theoretic model, together with a solution.10 In Figure 3.8 we show a game in which nature first decides on the type of the media and the politician  is it a media that values reporting on corruption or not? Is the politician one who has a dominant strategy to engage in corruption or one who is sensitive to the risks of media exposure? In the example the payoffs to all players are fully specified, though for illustration we include parameter \\(b\\) in the voters payoffs which captures utility gains from sacking a politician that has had a negative story written about them whether or not they actually engaged in corruption. A somewhat less specific, though more easily defended, theory would not specify particular numbers as in the figure, but rather assume ranges on payoffs that have the same strategic implications. The theory is then the game plus a solution to the game. Here for a solution the theory specifies subgame perfect equilibrium. In the subgame perfect equilibrium of the game; marked out on the game tree (for the case \\(b=0\\)) the sensitive politicians do not engage in corruption when there is a free press  otherwise they do; a free press writes up any acts of corruption, voters throw out the politician if indeed she is corrupt and this corruption is reported by the press. As with any structural model, the theory says what will happen but also what would happen if things that should not happen indeed happened. Figure 3.8: A Game Tree. Solid lines represent choices on the (unique) equilibrium path of the subgames starting after natures move for the case in which \\(b=0\\). To draw this equilibrium as a DAG we include nodes for every action taken, nodes for features that determine the game being played, and the utilities at the end of the game. If equilibrium claims are justified by claims about the beliefs of actors then these could also appear as nodes. To be clear however these are not required to represent the game or the equilibrium, though they can capture assumed logics underlying the equilibrium choice. For instance a theorist might claim that humans are wired so that whenever they are playing a Stag Hunt game they play defect. The game and this solution can be represented on a DAG without reference to the beliefs of actors about the action of other players. However, if the justification for the equilibrium involves optimization given the beliefs of other players, a lower level DAG could represent this by having a node for the game description that points to beliefs about the actions of others, that then points to choices. In a game with dominant strategies, in contrast, there would be no arrows from these beliefs to actions. For our running example, nodes could usefully include the politicians expectations, since the governments actions depend on expectations of the actions of others. However, given the game there is no gain from including the medias expectations of the voters actions since in this case the medias actions do not depend on expectations of the voters actions then these expectations should be included. In Figure 3.9 we provide two examples of DAGs that illustrate lower level models that support our running example. The upper panel gives a DAG reflecting equilibrium play in the game described in Figure 3.8. Note that in this game there is an arrow between \\(C\\) and \\(Y\\) even though \\(Y\\) does not depend on \\(C\\) for some values of \\(b\\)this is because conditional independence requires that two variables are independent for all values of the conditioning set. For simplicity also we mark \\(S\\) and \\(X\\), along with \\(b\\) as features that affect which subgame is being playedtaking the subgames starting after Natures move. Note that the governments expectations of responses by others matters, but the expectations of other players do not matter given this game and solution. Note that the utilities appear twice in a sense. They appear in the subgame node, as they are part of the definition of the gamethough here they are the utilities that players expect at each terminal node; when they appear at the end of the DAG they are the utilities that actually arise (in theory at least). The lower level DAG is very low and much more general, representing the theory that in three player games of complete information, players engage in backwards induction and choose the actions that they expect to maximize utility given their beliefs about the actions of others. The DAG assumes that players know what game is being played (Game), though this could also be included for more fundamental justification of behavioral predictions. Each action is taken as a function of the beliefs about the game, the expectations about the actions of others, and knowledge of play to date. The functional equationsnot shownare given by optimization and belief formation assuming optimization by others. Figure 3.9: The upper panel shows a causal graph that describes relations between nodes suggested by analysis of the game in Figure and which can imply the causal graph of Figure . The game itself (or beliefs about the game) appear as a node, which are in turn determined by exogneous factors. The lower panel represents a still lower level and more general theory ``players use backwards induction in three step games of complete information. These lower level graphs can themselves provide clues for assessing relations in the higher level graphs. For instance, the lower level model might specify that the value of \\(b\\) in the game affects the actions of the government only through their beliefs about the behavior of voters, \\(E\\). These beliefs may themselves have a stochastic component, \\(U_E\\). Thus \\(b\\) high might be thought to reduce the effect of media on corruption. For instance if \\(b \\in \\mathbb{R}_+\\), we have \\(C= 1-FG(1-\\mathbb{1}(b&gt;1))\\). If \\(X\\) is unobserved and one is interested in whether \\(S=0\\) caused corruption, knowledge of \\(b\\) is informative. It is a root node in the causal estimand. If \\(b&gt;1\\) then \\(S=0\\) did not cause corruption. However if \\(b\\) matters only because of its effect on \\(E\\) then the query depends on \\(U_E\\). In this case, while knowing \\(b\\) is informative about whether \\(S=0\\) caused \\(C=1\\), knowing \\(E\\) from the lower level graph is more informative. Note that the model we have examined here involves no terms for \\(U_C\\), \\(U_R\\) and \\(U_Y\\)that is, shocks to outcomes given action. Yet clearly any of these could exist. One could imagine a version of this game with trembling hands, such that errors are always made with some small probability, giving rise to a much richer set of predictions. These can be represented in the game tree as moves by nature between actions chosen and outcomes realized. Importantly in a strategic environment such noise could give rise to different types of conditional independence. For instance say that a Free Press only published its report on corruption with probability \\(\\pi^R\\), then with \\(\\pi^R\\) high enough the sensitive government might decide it is worth engaging in corruption even if there is a free press; in this case the arrow from \\(X\\) to \\(C\\) would be removed. Interestingly in this case as the error rate rises, \\(R\\) becomes less likely, meaning that the effect of a \\(S\\) on \\(Y\\) becomes gradually weaker (since governments that are not sensitive become more likely to survive) and then drops to 0 as sensitive governments start acting just like nonsensitive governments.
