</div>
<p>In this short conceptual chapter we describe an approach in which theoretical claims are thought of as model justifications within a hierarchy of causal models. Lower-level models serve as a theory for a higher level model if the higher level model can be deduced from the lower level model—possibly in combination with data. Consistency requirements determine what new theory emerges from the combination of prior theory and data, but also constrain what prior theories can be invoked to justify a given claim.</p>

<p>In Chapter <a href="illustratemodels.html#illustratemodels">3</a>, we worked with a set of theories. But we haven’t yet been very explicit by what we mean by a theory or how “theory” maps onto a causal-model framework.</p>
<p>In this book, we will think of theory as a type of <em>explanation</em>: a theory provides an account of how or under what conditions a set of causal relationships operate. We generally express both a theory and the claims being theorized as causal models. The theory is then is a model that <em>implies</em> another model—possibly with the help of some data.</p>
<p>To fix ideas: a simple claim might be that “<em>A</em> caused <em>B</em> in case <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>.” This claim is itself a model, albeit a very simple one. The theory that supports this model might be of the form “<em>A</em> always causes <em>B</em>,” “<em>A</em> always causes <em>B</em> whenever <em>C</em> (and <em>C</em> holds in case <em>j</em>),” or “<em>A</em> invariably causes <em>B</em> and invariably <em>B</em> causes <em>C</em>.” All of which might be arguments provided to support the simple claim: if you believe the theory you believe the implication.</p>
<p>The rest of this short chapter builds out this idea and uses it provide a way of characterizing when a theory is useful or not.</p>
<!-- We begin by elaborating upon our working definition of "theory," showing how it operates within a conception of models in "levels." This requires thinking through how a more detailed, "lower-level" causal structure can imply, and thus *explain*, a less-detailed "higher-level" structure. We also work through how the nodal and causal types in a more detailed model, and beliefs about those types, map onto types (and beliefs about types) in a simpler model. Further, we outline what kinds of elaborations of a simple model are possible (as we outlined in Chapter \@ref(models) what kinds of simplifications of models are permissible). We then turn to the relationship between theory and evidence in a causal-model framework, as compared to the way that relationship operates in a more conventional theory-testing approach.  -->
<p>In embedding theorization within the world of causal models, we ultimately have an empirical objective in mind. Theorizing a causal relationship of interest, in our framework, means elaborating our causal beliefs about the world in greater detail. As we show in later chapters, theorizing in the form of a causal model allows us to generate research designs: to identify sources of inferential leverage and to explicitly and systematically link observations of components of a causal system to the causal questions we seek to answer.
<!-- We discuss toward the end of the chapter how this definition of theory relates to common understandings of theory in the social sciences.  --></p>

To help fix the idea of theory as “supporting” or “underlying” the model(s) it theorizes, we refer to the theory, <span class="math inline">\(M^\prime\)</span>, as a <em>lower</em>-level model relative to <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> and refer to <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> as a <em>higher</em>-level model relative to its theorization, <span class="math inline">\(M^\prime\)</span>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.1.1</span> Implications of structural causal models</h3>
<p>Structural models can imply multiple other simpler structural models. Similarly structural models can be implied by multiple more involved models. Take the very simple model, <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>, represented in Figure <a href="theory.html#fig:Highlow">6.1</a>(a). The model simply states that <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> has (or <em>can</em> have) a causal effect on <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>.</p>
<p>What theories might justify <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>? This question can be rephrased as “what models imply model <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>?” The figure points to two possibilities. Both models <span class="math inline">\(M^\prime\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(M^{\prime\prime}\)</span> imply model <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>. They can be thought of as <em>theories</em>, or lower-level model, of <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>.</p>
<p>Model <span class="math inline">\(M^\prime\)</span> differs by the addition of a node, <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>, in the causal chain between <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>. We can say that <span class="math inline">\(M^\prime\)</span> is a <em>theory</em> of <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> for two reasons. First it provides a <em>justification</em>—if you believe <span class="math inline">\(M^\prime\)</span> you should believe <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>: if <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> affects <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> through <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> affects <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>. But as well as a justification it also provides an <em>explanation</em> of <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>. Suppose we already <em>know</em> that <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> affects <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> but want to know <em>why</em>. If we ask, “why does <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> affect <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>?” <span class="math inline">\(M^\prime\)</span> provides an answer: <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> affects <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> <em>because</em> <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> affects <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> affects <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>.</p>
<p>Model <span class="math inline">\(M^{\prime\prime}\)</span> differs by the addition of a node, <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>, that moderates the effect of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(M^{\prime\prime}\)</span> justifies <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> in the sense that if you believe <span class="math inline">\(M^{\prime\prime}\)</span> you should believe <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>. It provides an explanation of a kind also: if you believe model <span class="math inline">\(M^{\prime\prime}\)</span> you likely believe that the relation between <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is what it is because of <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>. Had <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> been different the causal relation between <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> might have been also.</p>
<p>A key idea, which we return to later, is that both <span class="math inline">\(M&#39;\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(M&#39;&#39;\)</span> involve a redefinition of <span class="math inline">\(\theta^Y\)</span>. That is we see a change in the endogenous nodes but these in turn imply a change in the interpretation of the exogenous nodes pointing into existing endogenous nodes (such as <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> in this example).
<!-- We return to the quantitative implications of this redefinition of endogeneous nodes below.  --></p>
<!-- In model $M$, $\theta^Y$ captures all the features of units that result in them responding in one or another way to $X$. However in model $M'$, $\theta^{Y_{lower}}$  only needs to capture the way that $Y$ responds to $K$ --- that part of the effect of $X$ on $Y$ that operates via $X$'s impact on $K$ can be partitioned off. in model $M''$, $\theta^{Y_{lower}}$  only needs to capture the way that $Y$ responds to $X$  goven $K$, uncertainty about the value of $K$ can be partialed out.  -->

Thus, for instance, the probability that <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> has a positive effect on <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(M_{higher}\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(\theta^{Y_{higher}}_{01}\)</span>; the probability that <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> has a positive effect on <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(M_{lower}\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(\theta^{M_{lower}}_{01}\theta^{Y_{lower}}_{01} + \theta^{M_{lower}}_{10}\theta^{Y_{lower}}_{10}\)</span>. COnsistency then requires that <span class="math inline">\(\theta^{M_{lower}}_{01}\theta^{Y_{lower}}_{01} + \theta^{M_{lower}}_{10}\theta^{Y_{lower}}_{10} = \theta^{Y_{higher}}_{01}\)</span> and so the value of <span class="math inline">\(\theta^{Y_{higher}}_{01}\)</span> is <em>implied</em> by <span class="math inline">\(\theta^{M_{lower}}_{01},\theta^{Y_{lower}}_{01}, \theta^{M_{lower}}_{10},\theta^{Y_{lower}}_{10}\)</span>, but not vice versa.</p>
<p>A probabilisitc causal model coupled with data implies another model via Bayes rule. For this reason we can fruitfully think of an initial model as being a <em>theory of</em> an updated model, coupled with data. Thought of in this way we have clarity over what is meant when we turn to theory to support a claim, but also what is meant when we seek to justify a theory. We might imagine a scholar arguing: “<span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>: <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> caused <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> in country <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>.” When pushed for a justification for the claim they provide the lower level model: “<span class="math inline">\(M:\)</span> the average effect of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> in countries with feature <span class="math inline">\(C=1\)</span> is 0.95, making it likely that <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> caused <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> in this case.” Here <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is implied by <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> coupled with data <span class="math inline">\(C=1\)</span>. If pushed further as to why that theory is itself credible they might point to a lower level model consisting of structural model <span class="math inline">\(X\rightarrow Y \leftarrow C\)</span> plus flat priors coupled with data on <span class="math inline">\(X,Y\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>. At each stage, as more justification is provided, the researcher formally provides lower level models.</p>
<p>Moving up, as more data is provided, more “specific” higher level models emerge, justified by lower models plus data. These models are more specific in the sense that they are implied by the higher level models, plus data, but not vice versa. But they are also more also (generally) more specific in a second sense: that they make stronger statements about how causal processes operate.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> They place greater weight on a smaller set of causal claims.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>As the simplest illustration, we might imagine beginning with an <span class="math inline">\(X\rightarrow Y\)</span> model, <span class="math inline">\(M_1\)</span>, in which, <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> are binary, and we we believe that <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> possibly responds to <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. If we have “flat” priors over causal types, in the sense described in chapter @(bayes), then our prior uncertainty over the proposition that <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> causes <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, under this model, is large; as is our uncertainty that <span class="math inline">\(Y=1\)</span> is dues to <span class="math inline">\(X=1\)</span> in a given case. In other words, given our theory, we are uncertain about the proposition <span class="math inline">\(M_3\)</span>: <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> caused <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>. However if we then receive a lot of data, <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>, showing strong relations between <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, then our updated model <span class="math inline">\(M_2\)</span>, formed from combining <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(M_1\)</span> allows us to infer that <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> caused <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> in this case with greater certainty.</p>
<p>Thus our new theory <span class="math inline">\(M_2\)</span> is (a) formally similar to <span class="math inline">\(M_1\)</span> (b) formed as a product of past theory plus evidence, here justified by <span class="math inline">\(M_1\)</span> given data <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> and (c) capable of providing sharper implications than past theory.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>In this way, Bayesian updating provides a simple and coherent way of thinking about the integration of theory and data.</p>
<!-- ### Generalizing a model -->
<!-- A lower-level model, $M^\prime$, can also be a representation of $M$ in which a node has been introduced that permits variation in a feature of context that is fixed and taken-for-granted in $M$. Here, $M^\prime$ theorizes $M$ in the sense of embedding $M$ within a *more general* set of beliefs about how the world works. $M$ then becomes a special case of the theorized relations, one that holds when we condition on some data, specifying some particularity of context. -->
<!-- To illustrate this approach to theorization, consider again graphs (a) and (c) in Figure \ref{fig:Highlow}. We have discussed how the graph in panel (c) can represent a disaggregation of $\theta^Y$ from panel (a) into $\theta^{Y_\text{lower}}$ and $C$. An alternative possibility, however, is to employ a moderation model that represents a more general claim than the higher-level model that it supports. For instance, the graph in panel (a) might represent the causal function $Y=X+\theta^Y$. In this model, $X$ always has an effect on $Y$. The graph in panel (c), in turn, might represent the more general function, $Y=XC+\theta^Y$ (where $C$ is binary). Now, whether $X$ has an effect depends on the value of $C$. In particular, model (c) combined with the observation $C=1$ directly implies model (a). Model (a) is a special case of model (c) that holds in and only in the context $C=1$. In answer to the question, "Why do you believe model (a)?" one could respond with model (c) plus the observation $C=1$.  -->
<!-- Note the difference in how theorization has proceeded for the two moderation models (both graphically represented in panel (c)). When we introduce moderation via the disaggregation of nodes, we pull content out of $\theta^Y$ and specify it substantively. When we generalize, on the other hand, we *add* a node, a source of variation not factored into the original model at all. We can think of that variation as implicitly conditioned-on in the higher-level model. -->
<!-- As a secondary matter, note that the $\theta$ term pointing into $Y$ may or may not be altered by the addition. In particular, we will explore later, if $\theta^Y$ is a vessel for causal types, then the number of possible causal types---and, thus, $\theta^Y$'s range---must expand as we add nodes pointing into $Y$. But in the functions we have used in our illustration, $\theta^{Y_\text{lower}}$ remains unchanged when we add the $C$ node. In both the higher- and lower-level models, $\theta^Y$ represents precisely the same random disturbance.  -->
<!-- $M^\prime$ is a *theory* of $M$ in that it, in a sense, helps explain the dependencies of $Y$ on $X$ more fully than does $M$. -->
<!-- Since lower-level models imply higher level models, we think of theories as implying the models they are theorizing. If we believe structural causal model $M'$, then we also must believe the structure of model $M$. If it is possible that $X$ can affect $K$ and possible that $K$ can affect $Y$, then it is possible that $X$ can affect $Y$. Similarly, if we believe Model $M^{\prime\prime}$, then we must also believe Model $M$: if it is true that $X$ can affect $Y$, possibly in ways that are moderated by $C$, then it is trivially true that $X$ can affect $Y$.  -->
<!-- AJ: I do not understand this line that was in the paragraph above: "The converse is not true, however. It is not possible to still believe that $X$ can effect $Y$ if you do not think that $X$ can affect $K$." Of course, it's possible, if you don't believe M' is the right lower-level model, right? I think I'm missing what we're getting at here. -->

<p>Theorization starts with the proliferation of substantive variables—adding beliefs about intervening steps in a causal process.

<p><strong>Two kinds of theories.</strong></p>
<p>Theories are “lower-level” causal models that explain or provide an account of a “higher-level,” simpler model. Two common forms of theorization involve disaggregation – for instance by articulating <em>mediating</em> and <em>moderating</em> relationships—and generalization:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The disaggregation of nodes. A single node in a higher-level model can be split into multiple nodes. For instance, for a higher-level model in which <span class="math inline">\(X \rightarrow Y \leftarrow \theta^Y\)</span>:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><em>Mediation</em>: A mediator, <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>, can be introduced between <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, thus splitting <span class="math inline">\(\theta^Y\)</span> into <span class="math inline">\(\theta^M\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\theta^{Y_\text{lower}}\)</span>. The mediation theory thus explains the <span class="math inline">\(X \rightarrow Y\)</span> relationship.</li>
<li><em>Moderation</em>: A component of <span class="math inline">\(\theta^Y\)</span> can be extracted and specified as a substantive variable. This variable is now a substantively conceptualized moderator of the <span class="math inline">\(X \rightarrow Y\)</span> relationship. The moderation theory thus provides a fuller explanation of why <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> has different effects on <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> in different contexts.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Generalization. A feature of context omitted and implicitly held constant in a higher-level model can be explicitly included in the model. The higher-level model is now explained as a special case of a more general set of causal relations.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p><br></p>
<p>Other possible ways of elaborating a modelincluding adding <em>antecedent conditions</em>—causes of nodes that were exogenous in the higher-level model—-and adding <em>downstream effects</em>: outcomes of nodes that were terminal in the higher-level model.</p>

Figure 6.2: A higher-level model and a lower-level model that is impermissible.
</p>
</div>
<p>The central principle governing allowable elaborations is that a lower-level model <em>must not introduce dependencies between variables that were omitted in the higher-level model.</em> We provide an example of a violation of this principle in Figure <a href="theory.html#fig:incompat">6.2</a>.</p>
<p>We start with a higher-level model, in panel (a), in which inequality affects democratization through mobilization. We then elaborate the model in panel (b) by adding ethnic homogeneity as a moderator of mobilization’s effect. However, because ethnic homogeneity is also modeled here as affecting inequality, we have now introduced a source of dependence between inequality and democratization that was omitted from the higher-level model. In panel (a), democratization and inequality were dependent only via mobilization; and so they are conditionally independent given mobilization. In panel (b), democratization and mobilization are additionally dependent via their common cause, ethnic homogeneity. By the rules governing causal graphs (see Chapter ), the higher-level model specifically <em>prohibited</em> this second source of dependency—since all dependencies between variables must be represented.</p>
<p>Put differently, if two variables are independent— or conditionally independent given a third variable—in one model, then this same relation of independence (or conditional independence) must be captured in any theory of that model. A theory can <em>add</em> conditional independencies not present in the higher-level model. For instance, a mediation theory, <span class="math inline">\(X \rightarrow M \rightarrow Y\)</span>, implies a conditional independence that is not present in the higher-level, <span class="math inline">\(X \rightarrow Y\)</span> model that it supports: in the lower-level model only, <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is conditionally independent of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> given <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>. But we may not theorize <em>away</em>s (conditional) independencies insisted on by our higher-level claim.</p>
<p>Return to models <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(M&#39;\)</span> in Figure <a href="theory.html#fig:Highlow">6.1</a>(a).
Importantly, in moving from the higher- to the lower-level model, we have effectively <em>split</em> the nodal-type term <span class="math inline">\(\theta^Y\)</span> into two parts: <span class="math inline">\(\theta^{Y_\text{lower}}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\theta^K\)</span>. Intuitively, in the higher-level model, (a), <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is a function of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\theta^Y\)</span>, the latter representing all things other than <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> than can affect <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>. Or, in the language of our nodal-type setup, <span class="math inline">\(\theta^Y\)</span> represents all of the (unspecified) sources of variation in <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>’s effect on <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>. When we insert <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> into the model, however, <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> now does not directly affect <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> but only does so via <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>. Further, we model <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> as acting on <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> in a manner conditioned by <span class="math inline">\(\theta^K\)</span>, which represents all of the (unspecified) factors determining <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>’s effect on <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>. The key thing to notice here is that <span class="math inline">\(\theta^K\)</span> now represents <em>a portion of the variance that <span class="math inline">\(\theta^Y\)</span> represented in the higher-level graph</em>: some of the variation in <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>’s effect on <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> now arises from variation in <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>’s effect on <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>, which is captured by <span class="math inline">\(\theta^K\)</span>. So, for instance, <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> might have no effect on <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> because <span class="math inline">\(\theta^K\)</span> takes on the value <span class="math inline">\(\theta^K_{00}\)</span>, so that <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> has no effect on <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>. Put differently, any effect of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> must arise from an effect of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>; so <span class="math inline">\(\theta^K\)</span>’s value must be either <span class="math inline">\(\theta^K_{01}\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(\theta^K_{10}\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> to affect <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> What <span class="math inline">\(\theta^K\)</span> represents, then, is that part of the original <span class="math inline">\(\theta^Y\)</span> that arose from some force other than <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> operating at the <em>first</em> step of the causal chain from <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>.
So now, <span class="math inline">\(\theta^Y\)</span> in the lower-level graph is not quite the same entity as it was in the higher-level graph. In the original graph, <span class="math inline">\(\theta^Y\)</span> represented <em>all</em> sources of variation in <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>’s effect on <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>. In the lower-level model, with <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> as mediator, <span class="math inline">\(\theta^Y\)</span> represents only the variation in <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>’s effect on <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>. Put differently, <span class="math inline">\(\theta^Y\)</span> has been expunged of any factors shaping the first stage of the causal process, which now reside in <span class="math inline">\(\theta^K\)</span>. We highlight this change in <span class="math inline">\(\theta^Y\)</span>’s meaning by referring in the second model to <span class="math inline">\(\theta^{Y_\text{lower}}\)</span>.</p>
<!-- Put differently, when we construct the lower-level model in (b), we are taking that part of $Y$ not determined by $X$ and splitting it in two: a non-$X$ input into $K$ and a non-$K$ (and thus also non-$X$) input into $Y$. -->
<p>Consider next model <span class="math inline">\(M^{\prime\prime}\)</span> panel (c) in Figure <a href="theory.html#fig:Highlow">6.1</a>, which also supports (implies) the higher-level model in panel <span class="math inline">\((a)\)</span>. The logical relationship between models <span class="math inline">\((a)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\((c)\)</span>, however, is somewhat different. Here the lower-level model <em>specifies</em> one of the conditions that comprised <span class="math inline">\(\theta^Y\)</span> in the higher-level model. In specifying a moderator, <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>, we have extracted <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> from <span class="math inline">\(\theta^Y\)</span>, leaving <span class="math inline">\(\theta^{Y_\text{lower}}\)</span> to represent all factors <em>other than <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span></em> that condition <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>’s response to its parents. More precisely, <span class="math inline">\(\theta^{Y_\text{lower}}\)</span> now represents the set of nodal types defining how <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> responds jointly to <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>. Again, the relabeling as <span class="math inline">\(\theta^{Y_\text{lower}}\)</span> reflects this change in the term’s meaning. Whereas in Model <span class="math inline">\(M^{\prime}\)</span> we have extracted <span class="math inline">\(\theta^K\)</span> from <span class="math inline">\(\theta^Y\)</span>, in Model <span class="math inline">\(M^{\prime\prime}\)</span>, it is <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> itself that we have extracted from <span class="math inline">\(\theta^Y\)</span>, substantively specifying what had been just a random disturbance.</p>
<!-- AJ: Have deleted the words "TEXT" and the paragraph that follows -- the runningsubs figure doesn't seem to be here anymore.  -->
<!-- TEXT -->
<!-- We can also read Figure \@ref(fig:runningsubs) as telling us the set of claims for which the lower-level graph in Figure \ref{fig:running} can serve as a theory. As we can see, the range of claims that a moderately complex model can theorize is vast. For each simpler claim, moreover, there may be other possible lower-level graphs---theories besides ---consistent with it. -->
<!-- Nodes with no parents in $\mathcal{U}\cup\mathcal{V}$ cannot be eliminated as this would entail a loss of information. The graph in Figure \ref{fig:K}(d) illustrates the importance of this. Here $K$ is a cause of both $X$ and $Y$, in other words it is a possible confounder. A higher-level graph that does not include $K$ still requires a $U_K$ node pointing into both $K$ and $Y$ to capture the fact that there is a confounder. -->
<!-- ^[The conditioning approach can also handle theoretical propositions in the form of structural causal models that make no immediate empirical claims but still have "empirical content" in the sense of being able to inform *conditional* claims. The claim "if $X$ then $Y$" says nothing about $P(Y)$ by itself. However, it says a lot about $P(Y)$ if $P(X)$ is known.] -->
<!-- One  effect of elimination is to render seemingly deterministic relations effectively probabilistic. For example, in the lower level graph $C$ is a deterministic function of $X$ and $S$. But in higher level graphs it can depend probabilistically on one of these: in submodel 21, $C$  depends probabilistically on  $X$ since $S$ is now a stochastic disturbance; in 34 $C$ depends probabilistically on $S$. This illustrates how unobserved or unidentified  features render a model "as-if" stochastic. Conversely, models that exclude this form of uncertainty implicitly claim model-completeness. -->
<!-- Consider a second manner in which a higher level model  can be deduced from a lower level model, this time in conjunction with data (or more broadly, ancillary claims): -->
<!-- 2. A higher level model may be formed by conditioning on values of nodes in a lower level model. Conversely, a higher-level functional model, $M$, can be theorized via a lower-level $M^\prime$ in which conditions shaping the operation of the causal effect in $M$, unspecified in $M$, are now specified. -->
<!-- To illustrate this approach, consider again the graphs in Figure \ref{fig:K}. Above we described how the graph in  panel (a) can be produced by aggregating $U_Y^{\text{lower}}$ and $U_K$ from panel (c). An alternative possibility is to simplify by conditioning: we derive a higher-level graph from $M^\prime$ by fixing the value of $K$. For instance, if $Y=XK+U_Y^{\text{lower}}$ in $M'$, then at $K=1$, we have the submodel $M_k$ in which $Y=X+U_Y^{\text{lower}}$. Note that, in generating a submodel by conditioning on $K$, we retain the term $U_Y^{\text{lower}}$ as we have not added causal force into $Y$'s unspecified parent. -->
<!-- Perhaps surprisingly, in this treatment, the theoretical support for a causal model is itself just another causal model: a set of beliefs about structural relations between variables. Thus, a theory is an object that is formally similar to an empirical claim.  -->
<!-- Would like to clarify last sentence above. -->
<!-- This next paragraph is hard to follow. The u's come out of nowhere. What's a mapping from R1 to R1? Generally seems like the points could be made more simply. -->
<!-- I THINK THE UNIVERSALITY AND PRECISION MATERIAL IS INTERESTING BUT NOT SOMETHING WE NEED TO DO ON OUR ROAD TO USING CAUSAL MODELS FOR CAUSAL INFERENCE. AND IT'S NOT EASY. SO I SUGGEST WE CUT.

We can, however, use the approach to assessment of two features sometimes considered important to assess empirical content of a theory: the level of *universality* of a theory and the degree of *precision* of a theory [@popper2005logic, @glockner2011empirical]. ***DEFINE THESE HERE.*** For instance, consider a theory over $X_1, X_2, A, B, Y$ that specified $X_1, X_2 \rightarrow Y \leftarrow A, B, g$ with functional equations: -->
<!-- $$Y = \left\{ \begin{array}{ccc}  -->
<!-- A + BX_1 & \text{ if } & X_2 = 1\\    -->
<!--   g(X_1) &\text{ if } & X_2 = 0 \end{array} \right.$$  -->
<!-- where the domain of $g$, $\mathcal{R}(g)$, is the set of all functions that map from $\mathbb{R}^1$ to $\mathbb{R}^1$, and the ranges of $A$ and $B$ are the real number line. Say the distributions over $A, B, X_1, X_2$, and  $g$ are not specified. Then the theory makes a precise claim conditional on $u_1, u_2, X_1, X_2$, and  $g$. But since the distribution over $\mathcal{R}(g)$ is not provided by the theory, the theory only claims knowledge of a functional form for $Y$ for those cases in which $X_2=1$. Thus in this case the *universality* of the theory for the claim "$Y$ is a linear function of $X$," is  $P(X_2=1)$. This is the domain over which the theory has something to say about this proposition. Note that in this case the universality is not  provided by the theory, but is rather an external proposition that depends on additional data. The *precision* of the theory depends both on the claim of interest and the distribution of root variables. For example, the precision of the theory for the causal effect of $X_1$ on $Y$ when $X_2=1$ depends on the distribution of $B$: the theory is more precise about this causal effect the less uncertainty there is about the value of $B$. Moreover, a theory that specified that $B$ has large variance would be making a precise claim about causal *heterogeneity*, even if it was imprecise about the causal effect. Again this feature cannot be read from the theory without access to ancillary information that the theory itself does not provide. -->
<!-- AJ comments: -->
<!-- - Not clear what the "this approach" is that this is illustrating a feature of. Expressing theory as structural equations?  -->
<!-- - There seems to be a more specific point here than just that we can assess universality and precision. In fact, it's actually that we *can't* assess these things purely from structural models. We need probabilistic models or information on variable values, no? -->
<!-- - Universality seems an odd term for a concept that is continuous. Generality? Coverage? -->

<!-- SAME THING HERE. AN INTERESTING POINT, BUT A SEPARATE ENDEAVOR.

Functional (but not probabilistic)  causal models allow for the representation of logically derived relations between nodes without implying any unconditional empirical claims; that is, all claims may be of the  *if-then* variety, as is typical for example of propositions derived from game theoretic models. The process of connecting such models to the empirical claims can be thought of as the embedding of these incomplete models within larger structures.  -->
<!-- Consider for example the claim that in normal form games,  players play Nash equilibrium.  This claim in itself is not a tautology; that is, it is not a result. It can be contrasted for example with the *analytic result* that when rational players play a game and players have common knowledge of the game structure and of player rationality they will only play ''rationalizable'' strategies. Even still, the Nash claim does provide a set of analytically derived functional equations that relate nodes that describe game forms to actions  taken, and from actions to utilities. Representation as a causal graph can make explicit what conditional independencies are assumed in the move from analytic results to empirical claims. For example, are actions independent of the game form conditional on beliefs about the game form; are utilities independent of expectations conditional on actions, and so on. -->
<!-- We give an example of one such model below when we turn to extensive-form games for a lower-level theory that supports our running example.   -->
<!-- #### Relation to technical literature -->
<!-- Formally moving from lower level DAG to a higher level DAG requires *marginalization*: assessing the joint marginal distribution of observed nodes in the higher level graph over the distribution of unobserved nodes in the lower level graph.  -->
<!-- <!-- In Verma and Pearl 1990 (Equivalence and Synthesis of Causal Models) these higher level models are called "embedded causal models." -->
<p>–&gt;</p>
<!-- Unfortunately there is no guarantee that the  margin of a distribution that is consistent with a lower level DAG will be consistent with any higher level DAG (techically, "DAGS are not closed under marginalization").  -->
<!-- In response, various types of richer graphs have been developed, such as "acyclic directed mixed graphs" (ADMGs) Maximal Ancestral Graphs (Spirtes and Richardson, Ancestral graph Markov models, 2002), or mDAGs (Evans 2015 (Graphs for Margins)). See also (Wermuth 2011) -->
<!-- ADMGs for example have directed and bidirected edges but no directed cycles and are closed under marginalization. -->
<!-- We use two approaches in our applications to engage with this problem. First we generally allow for *unobserved confounding* in models.  Second we will allow for the estimation of lower level models with unobserved nodes. -->
<!-- ### Integration of theory and empirics -->
<!-- The understanding of theory as a causal model has important implications for how we think about the relationship between theory and evidence and about theoretical development.  -->
<!-- In a common hypothetico-deductive framework, we formulate a theory *a priori*, derive its empirical predictions, and then test the theory by examining whether those predictions are borne out by the data. If the evidence does not line up with the predictions, the theory is falsified. We might then respond by amending the theory, but the amended theory must then be tested against new data. -->
<!-- As we will see in chapters to come, when we confront a causal model with data, we do not seek to confirm or falsify the model, but to update beliefs over its parameters. In particular, we can update beliefs about the (possibly joint) distribution of nodal types in the population of interest, potentially arriving a new theory.  -->
<!-- To illustrate the difference, consider @saunders2011leaders' argument about transformative foreign military intervention, discussed in Chapter \@ref(illustratemodels). As we noted, Saunders' argument---the particular causal effects operating across the causal linkages---represents one of roughly 4 million possible combinations of nodal types that could operate within the causal structure that the argument (on our reading, at least) assumes. For instance, her argument implies that the nodal type $\theta^B$ takes on a value such that the conditions $F=1, P=1,$ and $T=1$ generate $B=1$, and we get $B=0$ otherwise; that $\theta^I$ takes on a value such that $B=1, F=1$ and $B=0, F=0$ produce $I=1$, for either value of $A$; and $A$ has a positive effect on $I$ whenever $B \neq F$; and so on, for all endogenous nodes. It would make little sense to read Saunders' argument as implying that this combination of nodal types is the only one operating in the world. But we might think of the argument as implying that this combination appears with some frequency---it implies a belief that this combination of nodal types characertizes some substantial proportion of cases in the relevant population.  -->
<!-- If we were then to confront this model with data (observations of some set of nodes for some set of cases), we would be seeking not to *falsify* the theory but to learn about the distribution of nodal types, relative to some prior belief about this distribution. We could, for instance, start with only the causal structure and flat priors over all nodal types. Or we might start with Saunders' theoretical argument itself as a basis for placing greater prior weight on the nodal types implied by that argument. Updating based on new data then has the potential to shift our beliefs within this model's parameter space, toward beliefs in the prevalence of some types at each node and away from others. Our posterior estimates might suggest that the set of effects that Saunders' theorizes are more or less prevalent than we had *ex ante* believed. And, equally importantly, we can expect the very same kind of learning about all *other* nodal types that possible under this causal structure. That is, we can learn about the prevalence of effects across this causal structure that are *not* anticipated by Saunders' argument at all---such as, say, the prevalence of negative effects of $A$ on $I$ or of positive effects of $B \neq F$ on $I$s. -->
<!-- Of course, in updating over nodal types we are evaluating the relevance of Saunders' argument; if the nodal types implied by her theory turn out to have greater weight in our posteriors, her argument has in a sense been more successful in explaining the world than if those nodal types end up with less weight. But what we come away with is more than the assessment of "a" theory, understood as a single set of propositions about the way the world works. We learn about the world of the model as a whole---about all of the causal effects that it allows. On this view, we do not proceed via pure deduction, from *a priori* theory to empirical test. While our models might be informed by deductive reasoning (see Chapter appendix), we also *develop* theory through engagement with the data.  -->

<div id="gains-from-theory" class="section level3" number="6.2.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.2.2</span> Gains from theory</h3>
<p>One metric is to assess the <em>expected (squared) error</em> resulting from posterior beliefs. In other words: how wrong are you likely to be if you base your best guess on your posterior mean? Another way to think of the gains is as the <em>expected posterior variance</em>: how certain do you expect you will be after you make use of this new information?<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>In fact these two quantities are equivalent (see for example <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-scharf1991statistical" role="doc-biblioref">Scharf</a> (<a href="#ref-scharf1991statistical" role="doc-biblioref">1991</a>)</span>)–at least if you assess expectations using the same priors as you use for forming posteriors.</p>
<p>To see this, imagine a situation in which there is an unknown parameter <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> and we have a data strategy that produces a distribution over data <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, given <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>. Let <span class="math inline">\(p(q,k)\)</span> denote the joint prior distribution over <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> with marginal distributions <span class="math inline">\(p(k)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p(q)\)</span>. For any <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> there is posterior estimate <span class="math inline">\(q_k\)</span> and a posterior variance <span class="math inline">\(v_k\)</span>, both estimated using Bayes rule. The expected squared error is then:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ESE := \int_q\int_k \left({q}_k-q\right)^2p(k, q)dkdq \]</span></p>
<p>This takes the error one might get with repsect to any true value of the parameter (<span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>), given the data one might see given <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> and the inferences one might draw. The expected posterior variance can be written:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[EV := \int_k v_k p(k)dk\]</span></p>
<p>This takes the posterior variance, given some data, over all the possible data one might see given marginal distribution <span class="math inline">\(p(k)\)</span>.</p>
<p>To show that these are equivalent we take advantage of the fact that <span class="math inline">\(p(q,k) = p(k)p(q|k) = p(q)p(k|q)\)</span> and that <span class="math inline">\(p(q|k)\)</span> gives the posterior distribution of <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> given <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>. We then have:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{eqnarray}
ESE &amp;=&amp; \int_q\int_k \left({q}_k-q\right)^2p(q,k)dkdq \\
    &amp;=&amp; \int_k\int_q \left({q}_k-q\right)^2p(q,k)dq dk \\
    &amp;=&amp; \int_k\int_q \left({q}_k-q\right)^2p(k)p(q|k)dq dk \\
    &amp;=&amp; \int_k\int_q \left({q}_k-q\right)^2p(q|k)dq p(k)dk \\
    &amp;=&amp; \int_k\left[\int_q \left({q}_k-q\right)^2p(q|k)dq\right]p(k)dk \\
    &amp;=&amp; \int_k v_k p(k)dk \\
    &amp; = &amp; EV
\end{eqnarray}
\]</span></p>
<p>Note that the key move is in recognizing that <span class="math inline">\(p(q |k)\)</span> is in fact the posterior distribution on <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> given <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>. In using this we assume that the same distribution is used for assessing error and for conducing analysis—that is we take the researcher’s prior to be the relevant one for assessing error.</p>
<p>Moreover, it is easy to see that whenever inferences are sensitive to <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>, the expected variance of the posterior will be lower than the variance of the prior. This can be seen from the law of total variance, written here to highlight the gains from observation of <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>, given what is already known from observation of <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span>.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a><br />
<span class="math display">\[Var(Q|W) = E_{K|W}(Var(Q|K,W)) +Var_{K|W}(E(Q|K,W))\]</span></p>
<p>However although <em>expected</em> posterior variance goes down, it is still always possible that posterior variance rises. The increase in uncertainty does not however mean you haven’t been learning. Rather you have learned that things aren’t as simple as you thought.</p>
</div>
<div id="illustration" class="section level3" number="6.2.3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.2.3</span> Illustration</h3>
<p>For illustration say that it is known that <span class="math inline">\(X=1, Y=1\)</span> and that, given this information (playing the role of <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span>), the posterior probability that a unit is of type <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>—for whom <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> would be 0 were <span class="math inline">\(X=0\)</span> (and not type <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>, for which <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> would be 1 regardless) is <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. Say then that that under some theory we have <span class="math inline">\(\phi_b := \Pr(K=1 | Y(0)=0, Y(1)=1, X=1)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\phi_d := \Pr(K=1 | Y(0)=1, Y(1)=1, X=1)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Then what is the value added of this theory? Define <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> here as the query regarding whether the unit is a <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> type. Then the prior variance, <span class="math inline">\(Var(Q|W)\)</span>, is simply <span class="math inline">\(p(1-p)^2 +(1-p)p^2 = p(1-p)\)</span>.</p>
<!-- Would be best to  write down the theory as a structural equation that has phi_j as p(K=1|j) -->
<p>To calculate <span class="math inline">\(E_{K|W}(Var(Q|K,W))\)</span>, note that the posterior if <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> is observed is <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\phi_bp}{\phi_bp+\phi_d(1-p)}\)</span>. Let us call this <span class="math inline">\(\hat{q}_K\)</span>, and the belief when <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> is not observed <span class="math inline">\(\hat{q}_{\overline{K}}\)</span>.
In that case the <em>expected error</em> is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{Expected Error} = p\phi_b\left(1-\hat{q}_K\right)^2+(1-p)\phi_d\hat{q}_K^2+p(1-\phi_b)\left(1-\hat{q}_{\overline{K}}\right)^2+(1-p)(1-\phi_d)\hat{q}_{\overline{K}}^2\]</span></p>
<p>where the four terms are the errors when <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> is seen for a <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> type, when <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> is seen for a <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> type, when <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> is not seen for a <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> type, and when <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> is not see for a <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> type.</p>
<p>Defining <span class="math inline">\(\rho_K = (p\phi_b+(1-p)\phi_d)\)</span> as the probability of observing <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> given the prior, we can write the posterior variance as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{Expected Posterior Variance} = \rho_K\hat{q}_K(1-\hat{q}_K)+(1-\rho_K)\hat{q}_{\overline{K}}(1-\hat{q}_{\overline{K}})\]</span></p>
<!-- Making use of the fact that $\rho_K\hat{q}_K = ({\phi_bp+\phi_d(1-p)})\frac{\phi_bp}{\phi_bp+\phi_d(1-p)} = \phi_bp$ and similarly  -->
<!-- $(1-\rho_K)\hat{q}_{\overline{K}} = (1-\phi_b)p$, this can be written in terms of primitives as: -->
<p>With a little manipulation, both of these expressions simplify to:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{Expected Posterior Variance} =p(1-p)\left(\frac{\phi_b\phi_d}{\phi_bp+\phi_d(1-p)} + \frac{(1-\phi_b)(1-\phi_d)}{(1-\phi_b)p+(1-\phi_d)(1-p)}\right)\]</span></p>
<p>The gains are then:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{Gains} =1- \frac{\phi_b\phi_d}{\phi_bp+\phi_d(1-p)} - \frac{(1-\phi_b)(1-\phi_d)}{(1-\phi_b)p+(1-\phi_d)(1-p)}\]</span></p>
<p>Note that we still learn even if our posterior variance increases. For example say <span class="math inline">\(p = 1/5\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\phi_d = 1/3\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\phi_b = 2/3\)</span> and we observe <span class="math inline">\(K=1\)</span>. Then our prior variance is <span class="math inline">\(p(1-p) = 4/15\)</span>. Our posterior is <span class="math inline">\(1/3\)</span> and our posterior variance is 2/9, an increase. Even still although we are more uncertain we are wiser since we attribute a squared error to the guesses made by our former selves now of <span class="math inline">\((1/3)(1-1/5)^2 + (2/3)(0 - 1/5)^2 = 6/25\)</span>.</p>
<!-- .2 2/3 / .2 2/3 + .8 1/3 ) = .4/ .4 + .8    -->
<p>We begin with theory <span class="math inline">\(M_1\)</span> which together with data <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> implies claim <span class="math inline">\(M_2\)</span>. We then posit theory <span class="math inline">\(M_0\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(M_1\)</span>—and so <span class="math inline">\(M_0\)</span> implies <span class="math inline">\(M_1\)</span>, but <span class="math inline">\(M_0\)</span>, coupled with <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>, produces a claim , <span class="math inline">\(M_2&#39;\)</span>, that is different—and hopefully better—than <span class="math inline">\(M_2&#39;\)</span>.</p>
<p>We illustrate using a theory that allows use of the “front door criterion.”</p>
<p>Imagine we have data on three variables, <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>. We begin, however, with a model <span class="math inline">\(M_1\)</span>: <span class="math inline">\(A \rightarrow X \rightarrow Y \leftarrow A\)</span>, that includes nodes for two of the three variables, <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, but not <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>, as well as a node <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> for which we do not have data.</p>
<p>We see a strong correlation between <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> and infer <span class="math inline">\(M_2\)</span>: that <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is a likely cause <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>. Our inference under <span class="math inline">\(M_2\)</span> is uncertaing because we are aware that the correlation may be due to the confound <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>.</p>
<p>We posit theory <span class="math inline">\(M_0\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(A \rightarrow X \rightarrow M \rightarrow Y \leftarrow A\)</span>. This theory now lets us make better use of data <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>. If we observe for instance that <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> are uncorrelated, then we infer with confidence that in fact <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> did not cause <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, despite the correlation.</p>
<p>Thus, in return for specifying a theory for <span class="math inline">\(M_1\)</span>, we have been able to make better use of data and form a more confident conclusion. Critically the theory does not alter <em>priors</em> over our query. Our prior over the effect of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> may be identical under <span class="math inline">\(M_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(M_0\)</span>, but our conclusions, given data, differ.</p>
<p>This one reason to theorize our models — develop more elaborate, lower-level models to support them — is to be able to reap greater inferential leverage from the more elaborate theory. But how much more? For instance, what are the gains from a theory that introduces a node <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> relative to one that does not include <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>? What is the value-added of the more elaborate theory?</p>
<p>One approach to assessing the contribution of a theory is to calculate the mean reduction in Bayes risk. Suppose we start with a baseline model with variables in the set <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal W\)</span> and want to answer a query, <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>. We can then define the gains from theory as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{Gains from theory} = 1- \frac{E_{K|\mathcal W}(Var(Q|K,\mathcal W))}{Var(Q|\mathcal W)}\]</span></p>
<!-- <!-- AJ: Have tried to explain what Q and W are, and walk through the intuition behind this formulation. Make sure this is right. Also should the E not be in the denominator too? -->
<p>–&gt;</p>
<p>We can think of the Bayes risk as the inverse of an <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span> measure in a regression framework (see also <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-gelman2006bayesian" role="doc-biblioref">Gelman and Pardoe</a> (<a href="#ref-gelman2006bayesian" role="doc-biblioref">2006</a>)</span>): it is the variance in our query given what we have observed. Here we are defining the gains from theory as the degree to which we have reduced that variance by observing <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal W\)</span>, relative to just observing <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal W\)</span>.</p>
<p>Another approach is to ask: how much better are our guesses having observed <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> compared to what we would have guessed before, <em>given</em> what we know having observed <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>?</p>
<!-- <!-- AJ: Needs a sentence here introducing the terminology. Is this our term, expected wisdom? -->
<p>–&gt;</p>
<!-- Expected wisdom. -->
<p><span class="math display">\[Wisdom  = \int(q_0 - q)^2 - (q_k - q)^2 p(q | k)dq\]</span></p>
<p>This captures how much better off we are with the guess we have made given current data (<span class="math inline">\(q_k\)</span>) compared to the guess we would have made if we had a theory that did not let us make use of it (<span class="math inline">\(q_0\)</span>), knowing what we know having observe <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(p(q|k)\)</span>.</p>
<p>A modest advantage of this conceptualization is that we can still record gains in learning even if the learning operates such that the posterior variance is larger than the prior variance. Even so, the implications for strategy are the same since wisdom is maximized by a strategy that reduces expected squared error. –&gt;</p>
<!-- Other possible measures of gains from theory might include the simple correlation between $K$ and $Q$, or entropy-based measures (see @zhang2003properties for many more possibilities).  -->
<!-- For this problem the correlation is given by (see appendix): -->
<!-- $$\rho_{KQ} = \frac{(\phi_b+\phi_d)(1-2p)(p(1-p))^{.5}}{ -->
<!-- (p\phi_b+(1-p)\phi_d)(1-(p\phi_b+(1-p)\phi_d)))^{.5}}$$ -->
<!-- One might also use a measure of "mutual information" from information theory: -->
<!-- $$I(Q,K) = \sum_q \sum_k P(q,k)\log\left(\frac{P(q,k)}{P(q)P(k)}\right)$$ -->
<!-- <!-- here: -->

<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.2.4</span> Mappings are not 1 to 1</h3>
<p>The mappings between higher-level claims and theories may not be one-to-one. A single theory can support multiple higher-level models. Moreover, a single higher-level relation can be supported by multiple, possibly incompatible lower-level theories.</p>
<p>To illustrate, consider two “lower level” theories of democratization:</p>
<ul>
<li>(<span class="math inline">\(L_1\)</span>): <span class="math inline">\(Inequality \rightarrow Democratization \leftarrow Mobilization\)</span><br />
</li>
<li>(<span class="math inline">\(L_2\)</span>): <span class="math inline">\(Inequality \rightarrow Mobilization \rightarrow Democratization\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Note how these theories are incompatible with one another. While <span class="math inline">\(Inequality\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Democratization\)</span> are independent in <span class="math inline">\(L_1\)</span>, they are causally related in <span class="math inline">\(L_2\)</span>. Moreover, in <span class="math inline">\(L_2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(Inequality\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Democratization\)</span> are related only through <span class="math inline">\(Mobilization\)</span>, while in <span class="math inline">\(L_1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(Democratization\)</span> is directly affected by <span class="math inline">\(Inequality\)</span>.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>Now, consider the following three higher-level claims:</p>
<ul>
<li>(<span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span>): <span class="math inline">\(Inequality \rightarrow Mobilization\)</span></li>
<li>(<span class="math inline">\(H_2\)</span>): <span class="math inline">\(Inequality \rightarrow Democratization\)</span></li>
<li>(<span class="math inline">\(H_3\)</span>): <span class="math inline">\(Mobilization \rightarrow Democratization\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> can be supported only by one of these theories: only in <span class="math inline">\(L_2\)</span>, and not in <span class="math inline">\(L_1\)</span>, does <span class="math inline">\(Inequality\)</span> cause <span class="math inline">\(Mobilization\)</span>.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>However, our other two hypotheses could each rest on <em>both</em> of the lower-level theories, even though those two theories are incompatible with one another. <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> could be derived from (explained by) either theory: though the two theories differ on whether mobilization is a mediator or a moderator, they agree that inequality can affect democratization. Similarly, both theories imply <span class="math inline">\(H_2\)</span>, in which <span class="math inline">\(Mobilization\)</span> affects <span class="math inline">\(Democratization\)</span>, even though the two theories disagree on whether inequality is an antecedent to mobilization or a moderator of its effect.</p>
<p>Thus, multiple theories can usually be proposed to explain any given causal effect, and those theories need not be consistent with <em>each other</em>. When seeking an explanation for, say, <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span>, the choice between <span class="math inline">\(L_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(L_2\)</span> cannot be dictated by logical mappings between models; it must be drawn from a substantive belief about which set of causal dependencies operates in the world. On the other hand, <span class="math inline">\(L_2\)</span> <em>is</em> logically ruled out as an explanation of <span class="math inline">\(H_3\)</span>.</p>
<p>It is also true that any given theory logically implies multiple <em>higher-level</em> claims about causal relations. <span class="math inline">\(L_2\)</span> implies both <span class="math inline">\(H_2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(H_3\)</span>. Note, however, that the multiple higher-level claims that follow from a theory <em>must</em> be compatible with one another.</p>
<!-- So far we have been discussing the *structural* components of theories: we have seen how a given causal structure can be justified in terms of a more detailed causal structure. But theories also involve claims about what *kinds of effects* operate between variables. For instance, the belief that inequality *generates* democratization, of course, represents a different kind of theory from the belief that inequality *prevents* democratization, although the two might share a DAG structure. As discussed in Chapter \@ref(models), a *probabilistic* causal model comprises both a causal structure and beliefs about distributions over the exogenous nodes --- i.e., in our setup, over a model's nodal types. In an $I \rightarrow D$ model, for instance, probabilistic beliefs include beliefs about the probability that a given case has the type $\theta^D_{01}$ types and the probability that it has the type $\theta^D_{10}$. Thus, as we have with structure, we can think about how a set of beliefs about the distribution of nodal types at a higher level can be supported by beliefs about nodal-type distributions in a lower-level model. -->

</div>
<div id="consistency-1" class="section level2" number="6.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.3</span> Consistency</h2>
<p>If a lower level model is invoked to justify a higher level model then the relations implied by the lower level models must obtain in the lower level model. The lower level model must be consistent with the higher level model an vice versa. This consistency requirement relates both to structural and probabilistic relations.</p>
<p>For instance, suppose we start with an <span class="math inline">\(I \rightarrow D\)</span> model and the belief that <span class="math inline">\(Pr(\theta^D=\theta^D_{01}) = 0.5\)</span> – i.e., effects are positive <span class="math inline">\(50\%\)</span> of the time. On a structural level, as we have seen, this model could be supported by the model <span class="math inline">\(I \rightarrow M \rightarrow D\)</span>. But what beliefs about causal effects in this lower-level model might support the belief that effects of <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> are positive <span class="math inline">\(50\%\)</span> of the time?</p>
<p>As with structural mappings, we can imagine a whole range of probabilistic beliefs at the lower level that would be consistent with a given higher-level belief. In a <span class="math inline">\(I \rightarrow M \rightarrow D\)</span> model, we can arrive at a positive effect of <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> either through a combination of the nodal types <span class="math inline">\(\theta_{01}^M\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\theta_{01}^{D_{\text lower}}\)</span> (linked positive effects) or of the nodal types <span class="math inline">\(\theta_{10}^M\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\theta_{10}^{D_{\text lower}}\)</span> (linked negative effects). So, for instance, a lower-level model in which <span class="math inline">\(Pr(\theta^M=\theta_{01}^M)=0.5\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(Pr(\theta^{D_{\text lower}}=\theta_{01}^{D_{\text lower}})=0.5\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(Pr(\theta^M=\theta_{10}^M)=0.5\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(Pr(\theta^{D_{\text lower}}=\theta_{10}^{D_{\text lower}})=0.5\)</span> would be consistent with the belief that <span class="math inline">\(Pr(\theta^D=\theta^D_{01}) = 0.5\)</span>. So too, however, would a lower-level model in which <span class="math inline">\(Pr(\theta^M=\theta_{01}^M)=0.707\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(Pr(\theta^{D_{\text lower}}=\theta_{01}^{D_{\text lower}})=0.707\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(Pr(\theta^M=\theta_{10}^M)=0\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(Pr(\theta^{D_{\text lower}}=\theta_{10}^{D_{\text lower}})=0\)</span> equally implies <span class="math inline">\(Pr(\theta^D=\theta^D_{01}) = 0.5\)</span> in the higher-level model.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there is a whole range of beliefs about effects in the lower-level model that do not justify the higher-level belief. For instance, any lower-level model in which <span class="math inline">\((Pr(\theta^D=\theta^D_{00}) + Pr(\theta^D=\theta^D_{11})) &gt; 0.5\)</span> is inconsistent with the belief in a 0.5 probability of positive <span class="math inline">\(I \rightarrow D\)</span> effects and cannot serve as a theory of the higher-level model.</p>
<p>We will generally want to think of lower-level models with quite different distributional beliefs as representing different theories, as they will typically capture quite different substantive beliefs about how the world works. We can think of the first lower-level model, above, as one in which inequality can cause democratization via two mechanisms, either by causing mass-mobilization which causes democratizaiton or by preventing mass-mobilization which prevents democratization — while the second model is a theory in which only the former mechanism operates.</p>
<!-- #### Type consistency in a mediation model -->
<!-- We might then wonder *how* inequality might exert its effect on democratization. One possible answer, drawing on our model in Chapter \@ref(models) is that inequality can affect mass-mobilization, which in turn can affect democratization. This explanatory claim is visually represented in Panel (b) of the figure. Here, we can see that any effect of $I$ on $D$ runs through $M$. There are details of this graph that we will delve into later. But for now, it is sufficient to see that we have partly explained variation left unexplained by model (a). Model (b) allows us to say, for instance, that whether inequality has an effect on democratization has to depend on whether inequality has an effect on mobilization. Model (b) thus theorizes, in one important sense, a part of inequality's effect that is left untheorized in model (a).  -->
<!-- Whereas Model (a) has nodal types defined for $D$,^[All models also have a type defined for node $I$, but $\theta^I$ is unaffected by the movement between these models.] Model (b) has nodal types defined both for node $M$ and for node $D$. We thus allow $I$ to have a positive, negative, or no effect on $M$, with $\theta^M$ taking on four possible values, $\theta_{10}^M,\theta_{01}^M,\theta_{00}^M$,and $\theta_{11}^M$. Further, we allow for $M$ to have a positive, negative, or no effect on $D$, with $\theta^D_{\text{lower}}$'s possible values again being one of $\theta_{10}^{D_{\text lower}}$, $\theta_{01}^{D_{\text lower}}$, $\theta_{00}^{D_{\text lower}}$, $\theta_{11}^{D_{\text lower}}$. -->
<!-- We can now think about _combinations_ of nodal types in the lower-level model as mapping onto nodal types in the higher-level model. Table \@ref(tab:highlowmapping) illustrates. -->
<!-- |                    | $\theta_{10}^{D_{lower}}$  | $\theta_{01}^{D_{lower}}$  | $\theta_{00}^{D_{lower}}$  | $\theta_{11}^{D_{lower}}$  | -->
<!-- |:-------------------:|:----------------------------:|:----------------------------:|:----------------------------:|:---------------------------:| -->
<!-- | $\theta_{10}^{M}$  | $\theta_{01}^{D_{higher}}$ | $\theta_{10}^{D_{higher}}$ | $\theta_{00}^{D_{higher}}$ | $\theta_{11}^{D_{higher}}$ | -->
<!-- | $\theta_{01}^{M}$  | $\theta_{10}^{D_{higher}}$ | $\theta_{01}^{D_{higher}}$ | $\theta_{00}^{D_{higher}}$ | $\theta_{11}^{D_{higher}}$ | -->
<!-- | $\theta_{00}^{M}$  | $\theta_{11}^{D_{higher}}$ | $\theta_{00}^{D_{higher}}$ | $\theta_{00}^{D_{higher}}$ | $\theta_{11}^{D_{higher}}$ | -->
<!-- | $\theta_{11}^{M}$  | $\theta_{00}^{D_{higher}}$ | $\theta_{11}^{D_{higher}}$ | $\theta_{00}^{D_{higher}}$ | $\theta_{11}^{D_{higher}}$ | -->
<!-- Table: (\#tab:highlowmapping) Mapping from lower-level nodal types on $M$ and $D$ to higher-level nodal types on $D$.  -->
<!-- For instance, in a case in which both $\theta^M=\theta^M_{01}$ (there is a positive effect of $I$ on $M$) and $\theta^{D_{\text{lower}}}=\theta_{01}^{D_{lower}}$ (there is a positive effect of $M$ on $D$), we have a positive effect of $I$ on $D$---meaning that, in the _higher-level_ model, $\theta^{D_{higher}}=\theta^{D_{higher}}_{01}$. Two linked *negative* effects at the lower level likewise generate a positive effect of $I$ on $D$---and so map onto the same higher-level nodal type, $\theta^{D_{higher}}=\theta^{D_{higher}}_{01}$.  -->
<!-- Further, it is easy to see that if there is no causal effect at _either_ the $I \rightarrow M$ step _or_ the $M \rightarrow D$ step, we will have one of the null effect types at the higher level. This is because, in Model (b), $I$ cannot affect $D$ unless there are causal effects at both constituent steps. In other words, in Model (b), $I$ can affect $D$ _only_ through $M$ in this model; there are no direct effects or other pathways permitted. -->
<!-- To foreshadow the discussion in later chapters, these mappings of nodal types between levels are critical. They allow us to draw inferences about causal relations at a lower level and then *use* those inferences to answer questions posed at a higher level. For instance, if we can learn about the effect of inequality on mass mobilization (a question posed at the lower level), then we can apply that learning to answering a question about whether inequality affects democratization (a higher-level question). -->
<!-- The lower-level functional equations are formally similar though now each unit's outcome (given $X$) depends on two event probabilities: one that determines type with respect to the effect of $X$ on $K$ ($t_{ij}^{K}$), and one with respect to the effect of $K$ on $Y$ ($u_{ij}^{Y}$): -->
<!-- $$Y(K, u_{ij}^{Y}) = \left\{ \begin{array}{cc}   -->
<!-- i & \text{ if } K=0 \\ j & \text{ if } K=1 \end{array}  \right.$$ -->
<!-- $$K(X, u_{ij}^{K}) = \left\{ \begin{array}{cc}   -->
<!-- i & \text{ if } X=0 \\ j & \text{ if } X=1 \end{array}  \right.$$ -->
<!-- Thus, in the lower-level model, there are sixteen types that derive from the cross product of two independent random terms. -->
<!-- Critically, one can derive the higher-level types from the lower level types, and beliefs about the higher level types from beliefs about the lower level types. For example, using the nomenclature in @humphreys2015mixing: -->
<!-- \begin{eqnarray*} -->
<!-- \text{adverse: }u_{10}^{high} &=& u_{01}^{K}\&u_{10}^{Y} \text{ or } u_{10}^{K}\&u_{01}^{Y} \\ -->
<!-- \text{beneficial: }u_{01}^{high} &=& u_{01}^{K}\&u_{01}^{Y} \text{ or }  u_{10}^{K}\&u_{10}^{Y} \\ -->
<!-- \text{chronic: } u_{00}^{high} &=& u_{00}^{Y} \text{ or }  u_{00}^{K}\&u_{01}^{Y} \text{ or }  u_{11}^{K}\&u_{10}^{Y}\\ -->
<!-- \text{destined: }u_{11}^{high} &=& u_{11}^{Y} \text{ or }  u_{00}^{K}\&u_{10}^{Y} \text{ or }  u_{11}^{K}\&u_{01}^{Y} -->
<!-- \end{eqnarray*} -->
<!-- In the same way, the higher-level probabilities are implied by the lower level probabilities. -->
<!-- \begin{eqnarray*} -->
<!-- \text{adverse: }\lambda_{10}^{high} &=& \lambda_{01}^{K}\lambda_{10}^{Y} + \lambda_{10}^{K}\lambda_{01}^{Y} \\ -->
<!-- \text{beneficial: }\lambda_{01}^{high} &=& \lambda_{01}^{K}\lambda_{01}^{Y} + \lambda_{10}^{K}\lambda_{10}^{Y} \\ -->
<!-- \text{chronic: } \lambda_{00}^{high} &=& \lambda_{00}^{Y} + \lambda_{00}^{K}\lambda_{01}^{Y} + \lambda_{11}^{K}\lambda_{10}^{Y}\\ -->
<!-- \text{destined: }\lambda_{11}^{high} &=& \lambda_{11}^{Y} + \lambda_{00}^{K}\lambda_{10}^{Y} + \lambda_{11}^{K}\lambda_{01}^{Y} -->
<!-- \end{eqnarray*} -->
<!-- Importantly, even without specifying a distribution over $U_K$ or $U_Y^{\text{lower}}$, a lower-level structural model could be informative by restricting the *ranges* of  $U_K$ or $U_Y^{\text{lower}}$. For instance, a lower level theory that imposed a monotonicity condition (no adverse effects) might exclude $t^K_{10}$ and $t^y_{10}$---that is, increasing $X$ never reduces $K$, and increasing $K$ never reduces $Y$.  -->
<!-- We return  to this example below and show how observation  of $K$ can yield inference on causal estimands when  the theory places this kind of a structure on relationships. -->
<!-- #### Type consistency in a moderation model -->
<!-- Alternatively, we might wonder *why* or under what conditions inequality causes democratization. Our simple claim, in panel (a), allows that $I$ *can* cause $D$, but provides no information about the conditions under which it does so. Those conditions are implicitly embedded within $\theta^D$, where they are left unspecified. We could, however, theorize some of what is left unsaid in in panel (a). We do this in panel (c), where we posit ethnic homogeneity ($E$) as a moderator of  inequality's effect on democratization. Panel (c) represents a theory of panel (a) in that it can help account for variation in causal effects that is unaccounted for in Model (a). -->
<!-- Put differently, Model (c) gives substantive meaning to an aspect of the phenomenon that is merely residual variation in Model (a). Model (a) provides no account of why inequality has the effects it does, relying fully on $\theta^D$ as a placeholder for this uncertainty. In Model (c), $\theta^D$ plays a more modest role, with the substantive variable of ethnic homogeneity now doing some of the work of determining inequality's possible effects.  -->
<!-- We note one final possibility. Imagine that we started with the quite *specific* claim that inequality sometimes has a positive effect on democratization and sometimes has no effect (with democratization happening for other reasons). Suppose we believed this claim to be true for some, possibly not well defined, domain of cases.^[This claim could be graphically represented by panel (a), but would involve a more restricted range for $\theta^D$ and simpler functional equation, involving only two types.] Model (c) could serve as a theory of this more specific claim in that Model (c), paired with some data, could explain the claim. In particular, Model (c) paired with the data $E=1$---we are in an ethnically homogeneous context---produces the more specific claim. Here, it is the theory *plus an observation* of context that accounts for the specific claim.  -->
<!-- Similarly, take the functional equation $f_1: Y=X_1X_2$. Coupled with data $X_2=1$, $f_1$ implies the functional equation $f_2: Y=X_1$.  -->
<!-- ### Causal types in lower level models  -->
<!-- We have discussed theorization largely from a graphical perspective, showing how features of causal graphs change (nodes get split, combined, added, or removed) as we move down or up levels. But there is more that happens beneath the surface of a graphical structure when we theorize a claim: the space of causal types itself changes. We walk through how this works for the mediation and moderation theories described above.  -->
<!-- ### Mediation {#medtheory} -->
<!-- We begin with a simple claim: there are two binary variables, $X$ and $Y$, and $X$ may have an effect on $Y$. This claim is represented in Figure \@ref(fig:Highlow)(a) above. In this graph, $X$ is independent of $\theta^Y$, which means that it is as if $X$ is randomly assigned. -->
<!-- We will let $\theta^Y$ be a variable that ranges across our four different causal types, conditioning how $Y$ responds to $X$. While  $a, b, c$, and $d$ were heuristically useful as a way of introducing the  idea of a causal type, things will soon get more complicated, so it will be useful to have more flexible notation. Going forward, we will usually refer to causal types using $\theta$ notation, with subscripts and superscripts used to denote potential outcomes and outcome variables. In our binary $X \rightarrow Y$ setup, we can indicate the causal type governing $Y$'s response with notation of the form $\theta^Y_{ij}$, where $i$ and $j$ represent $Y$'s potential outcomes. Specifically, $i$ represents the value $Y$ takes on when $X=0$, while $j$ represents the value $Y$ takes on when $X=1$.^[The functional equation for $Y$ is then given by:  -->
<!-- $$Y(x, \theta_{ij}^{Y_\text{higher}}) = \left\{ \begin{array}{cc}   -->
<!-- i & \text{ if } x=0 \\ j & \text{ if } x=1 \end{array}  \right.$$] Thus, the translation from $a, b, c$ and $d$ notation is: -->
<!-- * *a*: $\theta_{10}^Y$. A negative effect implies that $Y$ is $1$ when $X=0$ and $0$ when $X=1$. -->
<!-- * *b*: $\theta_{01}^Y$. A positive effect implies that $Y$ is $0$ when $X=0$ and $1$ when $X=1$. -->
<!-- * *c*: $\theta_{00}^Y$. A null "chronic" effect implies that $Y$ is $0$ regardless of $X$'s value. -->
<!-- * *d*: $\theta_{11}^Y$. A null "destined" effect implies that $Y$ is $1$ regardless of $X$'s value. -->
<!-- To be clear, these $\theta_{ij}^Y$ terms are not random variables; they are the four _values_ (types) that the type-variable $\theta^Y$ can take on. -->
<!-- represented with the notation $u_{ij}$: we read the subscripts to mean that a unit of type $u_{ij}$ has outcome $i$ when $X=0$ and $j$ when $X=1$. Then let $u_Y^{higher}$ have a multinomial distribution over the four values of  $u_{ij}$ with event probabilities  $\lambda_{ij}^{higher}$. ; for example, let $u_X\sim \text{Unif}[0,1]$ and $X = \mathbb{1}(u_K<\pi^K)$. -->
<!-- For example if $U_Y^{higher}$ is distributed normally and $Y$ takes on the value 1 if $bX+u_Y^{higher}$ is above some threshold, we have a probit model.  -->
<!-- Now consider a theory that specifies a variable intervening between $X$ and $Y$. This theory is depicted in Figure \@ref(fig:Highlow)(b) above, where $M$ mediates the relationship. We see that there are now two $\theta$ terms, each representing a set of causal types for a different step in the causal chain. While $\theta^Y$ represented $Y$'s response to its parent $X$, $\theta^Y_{\text{lower}}$ represents $Y$'s response to its "new" parent, $M$. We now also need to conceive of a causal type capturing $M$'s response to $X$, and we let $\theta^M$ represent this type.^[This graph assumes no confounding in the mediating relationship either as the two $\theta$ terms and $X$'s assignment are all independent of one another.] -->
<!-- Now consider the alternative lower-level theory in which  $E$ is posited as a second parent of $D$. This graph contains the substantive assumptions that $E$'s value is determined independently of $I$'s, as well as the assumption that $I$ and $E$ are both as-if randomly assigned. -->
<!-- In this graph, we again have a $\theta_D^{\text{lower}}$ term, but it is a different object from $\theta_D^{\text{lower}}$ in the mediation graph. In this moderation model, $\theta_D^{\text{lower}}$ is more complex as it determines the mapping from two binary variables into $D$. $D$'s nodal type in this setup now represents how a case's outcome will respond to four different possible combinations of $I$ and $E$ values. Rather than four nodal types for $D$, we now have 16, as there are 16 possible ways in which one binary variable might respond to two binary parent variables (see Table  \@ref(tab:PO16) in Chapter \@ref(models)). -->
<!-- In Table \@ref(tab:PO16b) we give a mapping from a subset of these lower-level types to the higher-level types corresponding to Model (a).  -->

<!-- To illustrate, $\theta_Y^{\text{lower}}=$: -->
<!-- * $\theta_{00}^{11}$ means that $I$ has no effect under any value of $E$, and $E$ has a positive effect under any value of $I$.  -->

<!-- For instance, a case can have type $\theta^D_{01}$ in the higher-level model if it is of type $\theta^D_{0010}$ _and_ c in the lower-level model.

<!-- Again, the types in the higher level mapping are functions of the types in the lower-level mapping. For example,  a unit has type $u_{01}$ in the higher level model if $K=1$ and it is of type $u_{00}^{01},u_{10}^{01},u_{01}^{01}$, or $u_{11}^{01}$, or if $K=0$ and it is of type $\lambda_{01}^{00},\lambda_{01}^{10},\lambda_{01}^{01}$, or $\lambda_{01}^{11}$.  -->
<!-- We write this as: -->
<!-- $$u_{01} =  ((K=1) \land (t^{lower} \in \{u_{00}^{01} \cup u_{10}^{01} \cup  u_{01}^{01} \cup u_{11}^{01} \}) \lor  ((K=0) \land (t^{lower} \in \{\lambda_{01}^{00} \cup \lambda_{01}^{10} \cup \lambda_{01}^{01} \cup \lambda_{01}^{11}\})$$ -->
<!-- In the same way, the probability of type $u_{01}$ can be written in terms of the parameters of the lower-level graph.  Importantly, the parameters of the higher-level distribution  $u_Y^{higher}$ depend on both $u_K$ and $u_Y^{\text{lower}}$. Thus, unlike the mediation case above, the probative value depends on the likelihood of an *observable* event occurring. Specifically, the share of a given higher-level type is given by: -->
<!-- $$\lambda_{ij} = P(u_Y^{higher} = u_{ij}) = \pi^K\left(\lambda_{00}^{gh}+\lambda_{10}^{gh}+\lambda_{01}^{gh}+\lambda_{11}^{gh}\right) -->
<!-- + -->
<!-- (1-\pi^K)\left(\lambda_{ij}^{00}+\lambda_{ij}^{10}+\lambda_{ij}^{01}+\lambda_{ij}^{11}\right)$$ -->
<!-- For example: -->
<!-- $$\lambda_{00} = P(u_Y^{higher} = u_{00}) = \pi^K\left(\lambda_{00}^{00}+\lambda_{10}^{00}+\lambda_{01}^{00}+\lambda_{11}^{00}\right) -->
<!-- + -->
<!-- (1-\pi^K)\left(\lambda_{00}^{00}+\lambda_{00}^{10}+\lambda_{00}^{01}+\lambda_{00}^{11}\right)$$ -->
<!-- Conditional probabilities follow in the usual way. Consider, for instance, the case where it is known that $X=Y=1$ and so the posterior probability of type $u_{01}$ is simply $P(i \in u_{01} | X=Y=1) = \frac{\lambda_{01}}{\lambda_{01}+\lambda_{11}}$. Note that $\pi^x$ does not appear here as this $X$ is orthogonal to $u_Y$. The probability of type $u_{01}$, knowing that $X=Y=1$, can be written in terms of the parameters of the $u$ distributions in the lower-level graph.  -->
<!-- $$P(i \in u_{01} | X=Y=1) = \frac{ -->

<!-- We return below to this example and describe how the lower-level model can be used to generate inferences on relations implied by the higher level model.  -->
<!-- ## Rules for moving between higher- and lower-level models -->
<!-- Thinking about models as conditionally nested within one another can be empirically useful. It provides a way of generating empirical leverage on a causal question by plumbing more deeply our background knowledge about a domain of interest. When we more fully specify higher-level claims via a more elaborate, lower-level model, we are a making explicit unspecified conditions on which the higher-level relationships depend. In doing this, we are identifying potentially observable nodes that might be informative about our research question. -->
<!-- As we develop lower-level models to support our claims, or determine which claims are supported by our theories, what kinds of moves are we permitted to make?  -->
<!-- ## Illustration of unpacking nodal types -->
<!-- We now show more specifically how sets of nodal types in lower-level models map into nodal types in higher-level models.  -->
<!-- For concreteness, let us return to our democratization example and consider first the very basic claim that inequality can have an affect on democratization. We represent this simple claim in Figure \@ref(fig:demtheory5), Panel (a).

<!-- ``` -->
<!-- Next, the figure shows two models that can each *explain* Model (a), though in different ways. Model (b) answers the explanatory question, "*How* does inequality affect democratization?" Model (c) answers the explanatory question, "Why does inequality's effect on democratization vary?" or "Under what conditions does $I$ have a given effect on $D$?" Both theories provide richer, more interpretable accounts of the phenomenon of interest than the simpler model that they are theorizing. -->
<!-- These lower-level models also imply a set of nodal types that are richer than that implied by (a). Recall that in Chapter \@ref(models), we considered the idea that at any node, a nodal type may be conceptualized as a case-specific exogenous disturbance that governs the mapping from input variables to outcome variables. The type node $\theta^D$ can take on the values $\theta^D_{10}, \theta^D_{01}, \theta^D_{00}, \theta^D_{11}$, and this node can take on different values in different cases. However, differences in $\theta^D$'s value are left entirely unaccounted for. We are saying nothing about *why* inequality causes democratization in some places, prevents democratization in other places, and has no effect in still other places.  -->
<!-- Let us consider how Models (b) and (c) provide answers to these questions and how these answers map onto these models' nodal types. -->
<!-- <!-- To fix this idea going forward, we make a shift in notation and use $\theta$ to indicate that a node is a receptacle for causal types. Thus, $\theta_D$ here captures the case's causal type, or $I$'s causal effect on $D$ for a given case.  -->
<!-- In particular, if we  deploy our four-causal-type function from Chapter \@ref(models) we have:  -->
<!--   * $a$: $\theta^D=\theta^D_{10}$, then $D=1-I$ ($I$ has a negative effect on $D$) -->
<!--   * $b$: $\theta^D=\theta^D_{01}$, then $D=I$ ($I$ has a positive effect on $D$) -->
<!--   * $c$: $\theta^D=\theta^D_{00}$, then $D=0$ ($I$ has no causal effect) -->
<!--   * $d$: $\theta^D=\theta^D_{11}$, then $D=1$ ($I$ has no causal effect) -->
<!-- Knowing $\theta$ tells us how $D$ responds to $I$ and it ignores any heterogeneity between units as long they respond in the same way. For any causal type the model is *consistent* with $I$'s causal effect operating for different reasons for different units, but  -->
<!-- ### Implied consistency of priors -->
<!-- We caution that the mappings of distributional beliefs between levels is not always intuitive. Suppose, for instance, that we begin with no information about causal effects in a model and so want to set flat priors, meaning that we accord equal prior weight to all nodal types at each node. In Model (a), flat priors would mean putting an 0.25 weight on each of the following: positive effects, negative effects, zero effects with $D$ always $0$, and negative effects with $D$ always $1$. Now, suppose we engage in the same flat-prior-setting in the lower-level model, Model (b). That is, we put equal weight (i.e., 0.25 across the board) on all nodal types at node $M$ and equal weight (0.25 across the board) on all nodel types at node $D$. Surprisingly perhaps, setting flat priors at this lower level in fact implies a strong weighting *against* either positive or negative causal effects at the *higher* level. Now, we are saying that the probability of a positive effect at the higher level is $(0.25 \times 0.25) + (0.25 \times 0.25) = 0.125$; and likewise for negative effects.  -->
<!-- Put simply, the fact that the lower-level model involves more mediating steps between $I$ and $D$ means that more things have "line up"  for an $I \rightarrow D$ effect to emerge --- and so causal effects will be rarer under a flat distribution of nodal types in this model than they are in the simpler, higher-level model. Another way to think about this is that simply by spelling out the mediating steps in a causal chain, we can, perhaps indadvertently, generate beliefs that causal effects at the higher level are weaker than we might have thought. We can, of course, set priors at the lower level that would map onto flat priors at the higher level.^[Placing roughly 0.35 weight on a positive effect at each mediating step and 0.35 weight on a negative effect at each step implies approximately a 0.25 probability of a positive $I \rightarrow D$ effecta and a 0.25 probability of a negative $I \rightarrow D$ effect.] Our advice to researchers is, simply, to check for consistency of priors across levels: to ask whether the priors that we set at a lower level imply beliefs at the higher level that we are willing to live with.  -->

<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.4</span> Application: Formal theories and causal models</h2>
<p>In social sciences there sometimes seems to be a sharp divide between formal—analytic–theories and empirical claims.</p>
<p>Consider for instance the claim that the number of Nash equilibria is generically odd in finite games is often understood to be a theoretical claim. Unless there are errors in the derivation of the result, the claim is true in the sense that the conclusions follow from the assumptions. There is no evidence that we could go looking for in the world to assess the claim. The same can be said of the theoretical claims of many formal models in social sciences; they are theoretical deductions of the if-then variety <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-clarke2012model" role="doc-biblioref">Clarke and Primo 2012</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>In the standard (“hypothetico-deductive”) model; a theory originates in the mind and then retained or rejected if it is consistent with data <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-popper2014conjectures" role="doc-biblioref">Popper 2002</a>)</span>. In practice, this usually requires a step in which the formal theory is translated either wholesale or piecemeal into a set of empirical statements which are put to the test. We seek to confirm theories by developing and testing hypotheses about the similarity of a model or theory to particular features of the world. In both cases, a theory is posited—possibly on the basis of logic or background knowledge—and then assessed. The value (truth or usefulness) of the model itself is the object of inquiry. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-clarke2012model" role="doc-biblioref">Clarke and Primo 2012</a>)</span></p>
<p>The causal modelling framework allows for a different approach to combining theory and data, in which theories are represented as causal models that capture the ideal operation of the theory as well as the conditions under which the claims of the theory are expected to hold. The causal model can naturally include uncertainty about any or all assumptions and claims of the theory, allowing for an updating of the theory along with data. These are what might be called, at the risk of provoking ire, empirical theories. Theory, in this sense, is a collection of claims with <em>empirical</em> content: a theory refers to a set of proposition of causal relations in the world that might or might not hold, and is susceptible to assessment against data.</p>
<p>Though it is not standard practice, formal models produced by game theorists can often be represented using the notation of structural causal models. Moreoever, doing so may be fruitful.</p>
<p>Consider for instance the class of normal form games studied by Nash. In the canonical set up, each player <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> can choose an action <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_i\)</span> from set <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma_i\)</span> and receives a payoff <span class="math inline">\(u_i\)</span> that depends on the actions of all players. A particular game, <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span> is the collection of players, action sets, and payoffs.</p>
<p>For two players, for instance, we might imagine a representation of a game as shown in Figure <a href="theory.html#fig:nfg">6.3</a>.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>Here the only functional equations are the utility functions, the utilities, given actions, are the implications of the theory, and so this is just a theory of how outcomes depend on social actions. It is not (yet) a behavioral theory.</p>
<p>A behavioral theory might claim that in normal form games, players play Nash equilibrium. How might this be represented as a causal model? Figure <a href="theory.html#fig:nfg2">6.4</a> provides one representation.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span style="display:block;" id="fig:nfg2"></span>

</div>
<p>Here beliefs about the game form (<span class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span>) results in strategy choices by actors. If players play according to Nash’s theory the functional equations for the strategy choices are given by the Nash equilibrium solution itself, with a refinement in case of multiplicity.</p>
<p>This model represents what we expect to happen in a game under Nash’s theory, but it does not provide much of an explanation.</p>
<p>A lower level causal model might help. In Figure <a href="theory.html#fig:nfg3">6.5</a>
the game form <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span> determines the beliefs about what actions the other player would make (thus <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_2^e\)</span> is 1’s belief about 2’s actions). The functional equations for <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_2^e\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_1^e\)</span> might, for instance, be the Nash equilibrium solution itself: that is, players expect other players to play according to the Nash equilibrium (or in the case of multiple, a particular equilibrium selected using some refinement). The beliefs in turn, together with the game form (which contains <span class="math inline">\(u1, u_2\)</span>), are what cause the players to select a particular action. The functional equation for <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_1\)</span> might thus be <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_1 = \arg \max_\sigma u_1(\sigma, \sigma_2^e)\)</span>.</p>

</div>
<p>This representation implies a set of relations that can be compared against empirical patterns. Do players indeed hold these beliefs when playing a given game? are actions indeed consistent with beliefs in ways specified by the theory. It provides a theory of beliefs and a theory of individual behavior as well as an explanation for social outcomes.</p>
<p>The model in Figure <a href="theory.html#fig:nfg3">6.5</a> provides a foundation of sorts for Nash’s theory. It suggests that players play Nash equilibria <em>because</em> they expect others to and they are utility maximizers. But this is not the only explanation that can be provided; alternatively behavior might line up with the theory without passing through beliefs at all as suggested in some accounts from evolutionary game theory that show how processes might select for behavior that corresponds to Nash even if agents are unaware of the game they are playing.</p>
<p>One might step still further back and ask <em>why</em> would actors form these beliefs, or take these actions, and answer in terms of assumptions about actor rationality. Figure <a href="theory.html#fig:nfg4">6.6</a> for instance is a model in which actor rationality might vary and might influence beliefs about the actions of others as well as reactions to those beliefs. Fully specified functional equations might specify not only how actors act when rational but also how they react when they are not. In this sense the model in Figure <a href="theory.html#fig:nfg4">6.6</a> both nests Nash’s theory and provides an explanation for why actors conform to the predictions of the theory.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span style="display:block;" id="fig:nfg4"></span>

<p class="caption">
Figure 6.6: Formal structure of a normal form game.
</p>
</div>
<p>In a final elaboration we can represent a kind of underspecification of Nash’s theory that make it difficult to take the theory to data. In the above we assumption that players chose actions based on expectations that the other player would play the Nash equilibrium—or that the theory would specificy which equilibrium in the case of multiplicity. But it is well known that Nash’s theory often does not provide a unique solution. This indeterminacy can be captured in the Causal model as shown in Figure <a href="theory.html#fig:nfg5">6.7</a> where a common shock—labelled <span class="math inline">\(\nu\)</span>, and intepreted as norms—interacts with the game form to determine the expectations of other players.</p>
<p>The functional equation for expectations can then allow for the possibility that (i) there is a unique equilibrium invariably chosen and played by both (ii) or a guarantee that players are playing one or other equilibrium together but uncertainty over which one is played, or (iii) the possibility that players are in fact out of sync, with each playing optimal strategies given beliefs but nevertheless not playing the ssame equilbria.</p>
<p>Nash’s theory likely corresponds to position (ii). It can be captured by functional equations on beliefs given <span class="math inline">\(\nu\)</span> but the theory does not specify <span class="math inline">\(\nu\)</span>, in the same way that it does not specify <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span>.</p>

<p class="caption">
Figure 6.7: A normal form game with a representation of equilibrium selection norms.
</p>
</div>
<p>We highlight three points from this discussion.</p>
<p>First the discussion highlights that thinking of theory as causal models does not force a move away from abstract analytic theories; these can often be incorporated in the same framework. This is true even for equilibrium analysis that seems to involve a kind of simultaneity on first blush.</p>
<p>Second, the discussion highlights how the causal modelling framework can make demands for specificity from formal theories. For instance specifying a functional relations from game form to actions requires a specification of a selection criterion in the event of multiple equilibria. Including agent rationality as a justification for the theory invites a specification for what would happen absent rationality.</p>
<p>Third the example shows a way of building a bridge from pure theory to empirical claims. One can think of Nash’s theory as an entirely data free set of claims. When interpreted however as a proposition about the ways players <em>might</em> behave, represented as a causal model, we are on a path to being able to use data to refine the theory. Thus we might begin with a formal specification like that in Figure <a href="theory.html#fig:nfg5">6.7</a> but with initial uncertainty about player rationality, optimizing behavior, and equilibrium selection. This theory nests Nash but does not presume the theory to be a valid description of processes in the world. Combined with data, however, we shift to a more refined theory that selects Nash from the lower level model.</p>
</div>
<div id="theory_conclusion" class="section level2" number="6.5">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.5</span> Conclusion</h2>
<p>We see three gains from this conceptualization of theory. First it helps clarify what is required for theoretical justification of a model. Second it clarifies what is meant by explanation. Third it provides one framework to answer the question: “when is a theory useful?”</p>
<p>Our approach also shares with Clarke and Primo the idea that models are not full and faithful reflections of reality; they are maps designed for a particular purpose. In the case of causal models, the purpose is to capture relationships of independence and possible causal dependence. As we have shown, that is a purpose that allows for the stripping away of detail—though it also forbids certain simplifications (such as any simplification that removes a dependency between variables).</p>
<!-- Clarke and Primo see models as useful to the extent that they are similar to features of the real world in ways related to the model's purpose. Along these lines, a causal model will be useful to the extent that it posits relations of independence that are similar to those prevailing in the domain under investigation. -->
<!-- ### Connections to other writing on theory -->
<!-- We close this chapter by considering how the understanding of theory that we work with in this book compares to other prominent understandings of theory.  -->
<!-- **Theory as model.** Although @clarke2012model argue for a separation of the ideas of model and theory, it is common for social scientists to use the terms interchangeably to denote an abstract representation of some part of the world that is of interest. For instance, a model may stipulate that outcome $X$ can have a positive effect on $Y$ because $X$ can cause $M$ and $M$ can cause $Y$.  One can read from a model how things work in the context of the model: for instance, if $M$ does not obtain, then under this model, $X$ does not cause $Y$.   One can use a model to make claims about the world only by assuming a mapping from elements in the model to elements in the worlds.  In this sense a  model is best thought of as an object that may or may not be useful [@clarke2012model]; whether the model itself is true or false is, in this usage, not a coherent question.  -->
<!-- **Theory as empirical claim.** In common usage, "a theory of" a phenomenon is a direct claim about the phenomenon, in the world. The claim that natural resources cause conflict is a theoretical claim of this form. The claim is certainly not true by definition, and empirical evidence can be used to assess it. In this claim, the *theory*, as usually understood, is certainly thin; the claim is no more than an empirical proposition, and it possesses no internal logic. Yet, more elaborate collections of empirical propositions are easily constructed. For instance: natural resources cause conflict because they can finance secessionist claims in resource rich areas.^[This latter claim does seem to possess something like a logic; though it does not take much to see that the logic is just a slightly more elaborate set of empirical claims. The outcomes do not follow  *logically* from the causes----there is no logical reason why secessionist claims would cause conflict, but the theory---as a collection of claims---has implications similar to those in the model in the paragraph above: if there are no secessionist claims, then under this theory, natural resources are not causing conflict.] Theory in this sense can certainly be right or wrong. -->
<!-- In this book we take a somewhat idealist position and assume that we are permanently inhabiting a world of models.  -->
<!-- The distinction between the last two accounts is sometimes confusing, and  @clarke2012model make a case for cleaning up the language on this front. In their account, drawing on @giere2010explaining, a theory might be best thought of as a set of models accompanied by hypotheses linking the model to the question of interest in the  world.  -->
<!-- We see our approach to theory as models as following in the spirit of  @clarke2012model and  @giere2010explaining yet also as being consistent with the treatment of models in the literature on probabilistic causal models with which this book is centrally engaged. A nice feature is that it preserves a close associated between theory and explanation and it incorporates naturally the notion of deduction without requiring that models themselves are statements of the  *if-then* variety. -->
<!-- **Theory as generalization** In another of the many uses of "theory," political scientists often think of theorization as generalization. For @Van-Evera:1997 and @przeworski1970logic, for instance, theories are by their nature general statements that we can use to explain specific events. In this view, "Diamond resources caused Sierra Leone's civil war" is a case-specific explanation; "Natural resource endowments cause civil war" is a theoretical formulation.  -->
<!-- In our treatment of theory as a lower-level causal model, however, there is no generic sense in which a theory is more or less general than the higher-level claim that it explains. In this book's framework, we _can_ theorize by generalizing: when we elaborate a model by building in variation in a factor that was held constant in the higher-level claim, we are making the model more general in scope. If our natural resources claim implicitly applies only to weak states, we can theorize this claim by allowing state strength to vary and articulating how the natural-resource effect hinges on that claim.  -->
<!-- However, when we theorize by disaggregating nodes---say, by adding intervening causal steps---we have in fact made a more _specific_ claim. Natural resources may cause civil war under a broad set of circumstances. Natural resources will cause civil war *through looting by rebel groups* under an almost certainly narrower set of circumstances. Here, the more elaborate argument---the theorization of *why* $X$ causes $Y$---is actually a stronger claim, with narrower scope, than the simpler one that it supports.  -->
<!-- **The value of parsimony** @Van-Evera:1997 and @przeworski1970logic also express a common view in characterizing _parsimony_ as a quality of good theory. While they recognize that parsimony must often be traded off against other goods, such as accuracy and generality, _ceteris paribus_ a more parsimonious theory---one that uses fewer causal variables to explain variation in a given outcome---is commonly understood to be a better theory.  -->
<!-- We do not take issue with the idea that simpler models and explanations are, all else equal, better. But the succeeding chapters also demonstrate a distinctive and important way in which all else will often not be equal when we seek to use theory to guide research design and support causal inference. To foreshadow the argument to come, the elaboration of more detailed, lower-level models can direct us to new opportunities for learning. As we unpack a higher-level claim, we will often be identifying additional features of a phenomenon the observation of which can shed light on causal questions of interest. Moreover, our background beliefs---the prior knowledge on which causal inference must usually rest---are often more informative at lower levels than at higher levels: it will, for instance, often be easier for us express beliefs about causal effects for smaller steps along a causal chain than about an overarching $X \rightarrow Y$ effect.  -->
<!-- Making things more complicated, of course, still makes things more complicated. And we should avoid doing so when the payoff is small, as it will sometimes be. But in the pages to come, we will also see a distinct set of benefits that arise from drilling more deeply into our basis of prior knowledge when formulating inferential strategies. -->

<!-- ### Illustration of a Mapping from a Game to a DAG -->
<!-- Our running example supports a set of higher level models, but it can also  be *implied* by a lower level models. Here we illustrate with an example in which the lower level model is a game theoretic model, together with a solution.^[Such representations have been discussed as multi agent influence diagrams, for example in @koller2003multi or @white2009settable on "settable systems"--- an extension of the "influence diagrams" described by @dawid2002influence.]  -->
<!-- In Figure \@ref(fig:tree) we show a game in which nature first decides on the type of the media and the politician -- is it a media that values reporting on corruption or not? Is the politician one who has a dominant strategy to engage in corruption or one who is sensitive to the risks of media exposure? In the example the payoffs to all players are fully specified, though for illustration we include parameter $b$ in the voter's payoffs which captures utility gains from sacking a politician that has had a negative story written about them *whether or not they actually engaged in corruption*. A somewhat less specific, though more easily defended, theory would not specify particular numbers as in the figure, but rather assume ranges on payoffs that have the same strategic implications.   -->
<!-- The theory is then the  game plus a solution to the game. Here for a solution the theory specifies subgame perfect equilibrium. -->
<!-- In the subgame perfect  equilibrium of the game; marked out on the game tree (for the case  $b=0$) the sensitive politicians do not engage in corruption when there is a free press -- otherwise they do; a free press writes up any acts of corruption, voters throw out the politician if indeed she is corrupt and this corruption is reported by the press.   -->
<!-- As with any structural model, the theory says what will happen but also what *would* happen if things that should not happen indeed happened.  -->
<!-- ```{r tree, echo=FALSE, fig.width = 15, fig.height = 12, fig.cap = "\\label{fig:tree} A Game Tree. Solid lines represent choices on the (unique) equilibrium path of the subgames starting after nature's move for the case in which  $b=0$."} -->

<!-- To draw this  equilibrium as a DAG we include nodes for every action taken, nodes for features that determine the game being played, and the utilities at the end of the game.  -->
<!-- If equilibrium claims are justified by claims about the beliefs of actors then these could also appear as nodes. To be clear however these are not required to represent the game  or the equilibrium, though they can capture assumed logics underlying the equilibrium choice. For instance a theorist might claim that humans are wired so that whenever they are playing a "Stag Hunt" game they play "defect." The game and this solution can be represented on a DAG without reference to the  beliefs of actors about the action of other players. However, if the *justification* for the equilibrium involves optimization given the beliefs of other players, a lower level DAG could represent this by having a node for the  game description that points to beliefs about the actions of others, that then points to choices. In a game with dominant strategies, in contrast, there would be no arrows from these beliefs to actions. -->
<!-- For our running example, nodes could usefully include the politician's expectations, since the government's actions depend on expectations of the actions of others. However, given the game there is no gain from  including the media's expectations of the voter's actions since in this case the media's actions do not depend on expectations of the voters actions then these expectations should be included.   -->
<!-- In Figure \@ref(fig:gamedag) we provide two examples of DAGs that illustrate lower level models that support our running example.  -->
<!-- The upper panel gives a DAG reflecting equilibrium play in the game described in Figure \@ref(fig:tree). Note that in this game there is an arrow between $C$ and $Y$ even though $Y$ does not depend on $C$ for some values of $b$---this is because conditional independence requires that two variables are independent for *all* values of the conditioning set. For simplicity also we mark $S$ and $X$, along with $b$ as features that affect which subgame is being played---taking the subgames starting after Nature's move. Note that the government's expectations of responses by others matters, but the expectations of other players do not matter given this game and solution. Note that the utilities appear twice in a sense. They appear in the subgame node, as they are part of the definition of the game--though here they are the utilities that players expect at each terminal node; when they appear at the end of the DAG they are the utilities that actually arise (in theory at least).  -->
<!-- The lower level DAG  is very low and much more general, representing the theory that in three player games of complete information, players engage in backwards induction and choose the actions that they expect to maximize utility given their beliefs about the actions of others. The DAG assumes that players know what game is being played ("Game"), though this could also be included for more fundamental justification of behavioral predictions. Each action is taken as a function of the beliefs about the game, the expectations about the actions of others, and knowledge of play to date. The functional equations---not shown---are given by optimization and belief formation assuming optimization by others.   -->

<!-- These lower level graphs can themselves provide clues for assessing relations in the higher level graphs. For instance, the lower level model might specify that the value of $b$ in the game affects the actions of the government only through their beliefs about the behavior of voters, $E$. These beliefs may themselves have a stochastic component, $U_E$. Thus  $b$ high  might be thought to reduce the effect of media on corruption. For instance if $b \in \mathbb{R}_+$, we have $C= 1-FG(1-\mathbb{1}(b>1))$. If $X$ is unobserved and one is interested in whether $S=0$ caused corruption, knowledge of $b$ is informative. It is a root node in the causal estimand. If $b>1$ then $S=0$ did not cause corruption. However if $b$ matters only because of its effect on $E$ then the query depends on $U_E$.  In this case, while knowing $b$ is informative about whether $S=0$ caused $C=1$, knowing $E$ from the lower level graph is more informative. -->
<!-- Note that the  model we have examined here involves no terms for $U_C$, $U_R$ and $U_Y$---that is, shocks to outcomes given action. Yet clearly any of these could exist. One could imagine a version of this game with "trembling hands," such that errors are always made with some small probability, giving rise to a much richer set of predictions.  These can be  represented in the game tree as moves by nature between actions chosen and outcomes realized. Importantly in a strategic environment such noise could give rise to different types of conditional independence. For instance say that a Free Press only published its report on corruption with  probability $\pi^R$, then with $\pi^R$ high enough the sensitive government might decide it is worth engaging in corruption even if there is a free press; in this case the arrow from $X$ to $C$ would be removed. Interestingly in this case as the error rate rises, $R$ becomes less likely, meaning that the effect of a $S$ on $Y$ becomes gradually weaker (since governments that are not sensitive become  more likely to survive) and then drops to 0 as sensitive governments start acting just like nonsensitive governments.  -->

<li id="fn1"><p>We note that our definition of theory differs somewhat from that given in <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-pearl2009causality" role="doc-biblioref">Pearl</a> (<a href="#ref-pearl2009causality" role="doc-biblioref">2009</a>)</span> (p207): there a theory is a (functional) causal model and a restriction over <span class="math inline">\(\times_j \mathcal{R}(U_j)\)</span>, that is, over the collection of contexts envisionable. Our definition also considers probabilistic models as theories, allowing statements such as “the average effect of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is 0.5.”<a href="theory.html#fnref1" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>This is not universally true, a point we return to below.<a href="theory.html#fnref2" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn3"><p>In frequentist frameworks we often think of analysis as implementing up-or-down empirical tests against data to parse between theories that should be maintained and theories that should be rejected. In a Bayesian framework we think more continuously of shifting our beliefs across causal possibilities within a multi-dimensional theoretical space.<a href="theory.html#fnref3" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn4"><p>As a general matter an updated theory may not provider sharper claims for all queries. That is, in practice, posterio variance over queries can increase with more data. As a simple illustration; say I start out thinking that the probability that an outcome is due to A, B, or C is .9, .05, .05, respectively; I find evidence that convicnes me that A is not the cause, then I shift (a) to greater certainty about whether A was the cause but (b) greater uncertainty about whether B was the cause.<a href="theory.html#fnref4" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn5"><p>As we emphasize further below, it is in fact only the random, unknown component of the <span class="math inline">\(X\rightarrow K\)</span> link that makes the addition of <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> potentially informative as a matter of research design: if <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> were a deterministic function of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> only, then knowledge of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> would provide full knowledge of <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>, and nothing could be learned from observing <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>.<a href="theory.html#fnref5" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn6"><p>Other loss functions could be used, including functions that take account of the costs of collecting additional data or to the risks associated with false diagnoses. For instance, in <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-heckerman1991toward" role="doc-biblioref">Heckerman, Horvitz, and Nathwani</a> (<a href="#ref-heckerman1991toward" role="doc-biblioref">1991</a>)</span>, an objective function is generated using expected utility gains from diagnoses generated based on new information over diagnoses based on what is believed already. In their treatment <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-heckerman1991toward" role="doc-biblioref">Heckerman, Horvitz, and Nathwani 1991</a>, Equation 6)</span>, the expected value of new information <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>, given existing information <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> is: <span class="math inline">\(\sum{K}P(K|W)( EU(d(Q,W,K)|W, K) - EU(d(Q, W)|W, K))\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(EU\)</span> is expected utility and <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> is the optimal inference (diagnosis) given available data. Note that the diagnosis can take account of <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> when it is observed, but the expected utility depends on <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> whether or not it is observed, as <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> carries information about the state of interest.<a href="theory.html#fnref6" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>

A similar expression can be given for the expected posterior variance from learning <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> in addition to <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> when <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> is not yet known.
