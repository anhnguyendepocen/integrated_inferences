*Quick Guide*

This book has four main parts:

* Part I introduces causal models and a Bayesian approach to learning about them and drawing inferences from them.

* Part II applies these tools to strategies that use  process tracing, mixed methods, and "model aggregation."

* Part III turns to design decisions, exploring strategies for assessing what kind of data is most useful for addressing different kinds of research questions given knowledge to date about a population or a case.

* Everything up to Part IV assumes that we have access to models we are happy with. In Part IV we turn to the difficult question of model justification and outline a range of strategies on can use to justify causal models. 

We have developed an `R` package `CausalQueries` that accompanies this book, hosted on [Cran](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/CausalQueries/index.html). In addition, a supplementary [Guide to Causal Models](https://macartan.github.io/causalmodels/) serves as a guide to the package and provides the code behind many of the mode models used in this book.
