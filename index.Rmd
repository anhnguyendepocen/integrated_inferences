*Quick Guide*

This book has four main parts:

* Part I introduces causal models and a Bayesian approach to learning about them and drawing inferences from them.

* Part II applies these tools to strategies of learning from process tracing and mixed methods research, with applications.

* Part III turn to design decisions, exploring strategies for assessing what kind of data is most useful for addressing different kinds of research questions given knowledge to date about a population or a case.

* Everything up to Part IV assumes that we have access to models we are happy with. In Part IV we turn to the difficult question of model justification and outline a range of strategies on can use to justify causal models. 

There is also  an accompanying `R` package currently hosted on github. This can be downloaded and installed as follows:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("macartan/gbiqq")
```

An  [appendix](#examplesappendix)  shows how to use the package for defining and learning from a set of canonical causal models.
